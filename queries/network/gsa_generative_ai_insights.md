## Overview

**Microsoft Global Secure Access (GSA / Entra Internet Access)** inspects user and agent web traffic at the network edge and emits a dedicated **Generative AI Insights** stream. This gives the SOC a **network-layer** view of AI usage that is **application-agnostic** — it sees consumer and third-party GenAI apps (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) and **any** MCP server reached over the wire, including shadow/unsanctioned servers that app-layer telemetry (`CopilotActivity`, `UnifiedAgentObservability`) never observes.

This file covers the **two sides** of GSA GenAI telemetry:

| Side | What it captures | Anchor table | Star field |
|------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| 🔵 **Client / Prompt** | A user typing prompts into ChatGPT / Gemini through GSA — full prompt text, plus the **allow/block** verdict of AI-prompt-inspection policies | `NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights` (`Activity == "Prompt"`) ⋈ `NetworkAccessTraffic` | `Content` (plaintext prompt) |
| 🔵 **Agent / MCP** | A Copilot Studio (or other) agent making **Model Context Protocol** calls to MCP servers — the JSON-RPC handshake and every `tools/call` with the tool name | `NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights` (`Activity == "Mcp"`) ⋈ `NetworkAccessTraffic` | `Content` (JSON-RPC payload) |

> **The block verdict is NOT in the GenAI Insights table.** `NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights` records *what* was sent (prompt / MCP payload). The **policy decision** (`Action`, `PolicyName`, `RuleName`, `ResponseCode`) lives in `NetworkAccessTraffic`. The two are correlated on **`TransactionId`** — this join is the backbone of nearly every detection below.

### How GSA GenAI Insights relates to the other AI tables

GSA gives the **network view**; the existing AI query files give the **application view**. They are complementary — for a Copilot Studio agent, GSA sees the **same MCP `tools/call` egress** that Agent 365 sees from the runtime SDK side.

| Table / file | Layer | Sees | Use when |
|--------------|-------|------|----------|
| **`NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights`** (this file) | **Network** (GSA edge) | **Any** GenAI app + **any** MCP server on the wire (incl. shadow/3rd-party); prompt text; allow/block policy verdict | Shadow-AI / shadow-MCP discovery, prompt-injection blocking, network-side agent egress |
| [`copilot_activity_investigation.md`](../cloud/copilot_activity_investigation.md) (`CopilotActivity`) | Application | All **Microsoft** Copilot surfaces (M365, Security Copilot, Studio agents) — interaction records, jailbreak verdicts, accessed resources | Microsoft-Copilot AI-activity reconstruction |
| [`agent365_observability.md`](../cloud/agent365_observability.md) (`UnifiedAgentObservability`) | Application (agent runtime) | Copilot Studio / A365 agent **runtime** tool calls with full request + response arguments | Deep agentic tool-call forensics (the SDK side of the same MCP calls GSA sees on the wire) |

**Decision rule:** Start **here** to discover *which* AI apps and MCP servers are reached over the network and *whether policy blocked them*. Pivot to `CopilotActivity` / `UnifiedAgentObservability` for the in-app interaction record and tool-call arguments. For a Copilot Studio agent, **correlate by tool name + time window** across this file and `agent365_observability.md`.

### ⚠️ Critical Table Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Queryable in both Advanced Hunting and Data Lake** | These are GSA connector tables surfaced into the connected workspace — **not** Data-Lake-only. Prefer **Advanced Hunting** (`RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`, free, ≤30d). For >30d use `query_lake` (Data Lake, 90d). |
| **`TimeGenerated`, not `Timestamp`** | All four tables are network/connector (Sentinel/LA) tables. Use **`TimeGenerated`** in **both** AH and Data Lake. `Timestamp` returns `Failed to resolve column`. |
| **Block verdict is in `NetworkAccessTraffic`, not the GenAI table** | `NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights` has **no** `Action` / `PolicyName` / `RuleName` / `CloudAppName` / `ResponseCode` columns. Join to `NetworkAccessTraffic` on **`TransactionId`** to get the policy decision and the app name. |
| **`Content` can be large (up to ~65 KB)** | The prompt / JSON-RPC payload. **Never** `tostring(Content) has "x"` to filter — `parse_json(Content)` once and extract the specific field (`.params.name`, `.method`), or `substring()` a preview. Filtering with `matches regex` on the materialized string is acceptable for keyword hunts. |
| **Prompt rows have `SubActivity` empty and `EventType == "Request"` only** | `Activity == "Prompt"` rows carry the prompt in `Content` with `SubActivity == ""`. There is no paired Response row. |
| **MCP `Request` + `Response` share an `EventId`** | `Activity == "Mcp"` operations emit two rows (`EventType` = `Request` / `Response`) with the **same `EventId`**. Filter `EventType == "Request"` to get one row per operation and to read the outbound payload (`tools/call` arguments). |
| **`SessionId` is frequently EMPTY** | On `Prompt` rows `SessionId` is empty; on many `Mcp` rows too. **`TransactionId` is the reliable correlation key** to `NetworkAccessTraffic` (and across Request/Response use `EventId`). |
| **`McpServerName` / `McpClientName` are often EMPTY** | Use **`DestinationUrl`** as the reliable MCP server identifier (e.g. `http://sentinel.microsoft.com/mcp/custom/data-exploration`). `McpClientName == "mcs"` indicates Copilot Studio when populated. |
| **Deployed schema lags the published reference** | The Azure Monitor reference for `NetworkAccessTraffic` lists newer agentic columns (`IsAgentic`, `IsTokenAgentic`, `AIDetectionConfidence`, `AIDetectionEvidence`). These are **not deployed in all tenants** — filtering them returns `SemanticError`. The deployed table **does** have `AIAgentId` / `AIAgentName` (the agent's **schema name**, e.g. `copilots_header_xxxxx`), but they may be **empty**. **Verify with `getschema` before relying on agentic columns**; identify Copilot Studio agent traffic via `HttpUserAgent startswith "CopilotStudio"` as the robust fallback. |
| **`NetworkAccessConnectionEvents` has no `TransactionId` / `Action`** | It is **connection-level** (one row per L3/L4 connection). Join to `NetworkAccessTraffic` on **`ConnectionId`** to reach the transaction, then to the GenAI table on `TransactionId`. It carries device + source-geo context (`ClientDeviceName`, `DeviceOperatingSystem`, `SourceIpCity`, `SourceIpCountryCode`) and the evaluating `SecurityProfileName` / `SecurityPolicyName`. **Always `where isnotempty(ConnectionId)` on both sides** — empty `ConnectionId` causes loose joins. |
| **`NetworkSessions` is an ASIM table — may be empty** | The normalized `NetworkSessions` (ASIM Network Session schema) resolves in Advanced Hunting but is **not populated by GSA in every tenant** (returns 0 rows where the ASIM normalization isn't enabled). Treat it as an **optional** correlation layer — skip gracefully if empty. The authoritative GSA data is in the three `NetworkAccess*` tables. |
| **`CloudAppCategory` / `SecurityProfileName` may be blank** | In lab / lightly-configured tenants these enrichment fields are empty. Do not depend on them as filters; use `CloudAppName` and `PolicyName` / `RuleName` instead. |

## Queries

### Query 1: GSA GenAI Activity Overview

**Purpose:** First-look orientation — splits all GSA GenAI telemetry by `Activity` (Prompt vs Mcp), `SubActivity` (MCP method), and `EventType` (Request/Response). Establishes the volume and shape of client-prompt vs agent-MCP activity in the tenant.  
**Severity:** Informational  
**MITRE:** TA0009

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Statistical posture overview (summarize by activity/subactivity) — not a detection."
-->

```kql
NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize
    Events = count(),
    Users = dcount(UserPrincipalName),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by Activity, SubActivity, EventType
| order by Events desc
```

---

### Query 2: Prompt Inventory by User & App

**Purpose:** Who is sending prompts to which consumer GenAI app, and how many. `DestinationUrl` distinguishes the app (Gemini vs ChatGPT vs others); `parse_url().Host` normalizes it to the app host. Baseline of GenAI adoption per user.  
**Severity:** Informational  
**MITRE:** TA0009

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Per-user/app prompt-volume baseline — not a detection."
-->

```kql
NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where Activity == "Prompt"
| extend DestHost = tostring(parse_url(DestinationUrl).Host)
| summarize
    Prompts = count(),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by UserPrincipalName, DestHost
| order by Prompts desc
```

---

### Query 3: Prompt-Injection Blocks

**Purpose:** **The flagship client-side detection.** Surfaces prompts that a GSA AI-prompt-inspection policy **blocked** — joins the prompt text (`NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights`, `Activity == "Prompt"`) to the blocking verdict (`NetworkAccessTraffic`, `Action == "Block"`) on `TransactionId`. Reveals the user, the app, the enforcing policy/rule, and a preview of the malicious prompt.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1078.004, TA0001  
**Tuning Notes:** True positives are users attempting jailbreak / prompt-injection against consumer GenAI. Review the full `Content` and the user's surrounding activity. Blocks are driven by the AI-prompt-inspection policy (e.g. `PolicyName == "Inspect AI Prompts"`, `RuleName == "Block Malicious Prompts"`); confirm the policy is attached to **all** sanctioned GenAI apps (see Q4 for the coverage gap).

          PromptPreview = substring(PromptText, 0, 200)
| order by PromptTime desc
```

---

### Query 4: Prompt Policy Coverage — Allowed vs Blocked by App

**Purpose:** **Surfaces the coverage gap.** For every GenAI app that received prompts, compares how many were allowed vs blocked and which policies/rules applied. A common finding: the AI-prompt-inspection policy is attached to one app (e.g. Gemini) but **not** another (e.g. ChatGPT) — so identical injection prompts are blocked on one and pass on the other.  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** TA0001

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregated allow/block coverage comparison by app — posture/gap analysis, not a row-level detection."
-->

```kql
let prompts = NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
    | where Activity == "Prompt"
    | distinct TransactionId;
NetworkAccessTraffic
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where isnotempty(TransactionId)
| join kind=inner (prompts) on TransactionId
| summarize
    Prompts = count(),
    Blocked = countif(Action == "Block"),
    Allowed = countif(Action == "Allow"),
    Policies = make_set(PolicyName, 5),
    Rules = make_set(RuleName, 5)
    by CloudAppName
| extend BlockRatePct = round(100.0 * Blocked / Prompts, 1)
| order by Prompts desc
```

> **Reading the gap:** an app with `Prompts > 0` but `Blocked == 0` and `Policies` containing only `"All websites"` / `RuleName == "*"` has **no AI-prompt-inspection policy attached** — a coverage gap. Attach the AI-prompt policy to that app in the GSA portal.

---

### Query 5: GenAI App Inventory — Shadow-AI Discovery

**Purpose:** Inventories every GenAI app GSA classified as carrying prompt traffic, with user reach and the allow/block actions seen. Because GSA inspects at the network edge, this discovers **shadow / unsanctioned** GenAI apps in use that no app-layer connector reports.  
**Severity:** Low  
**MITRE:** TA0009, T1567.002

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregated GenAI app inventory (shadow-AI discovery) — posture, not a row-level detection."
-->

```kql
let genaiTx = NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
    | where Activity == "Prompt"
    | distinct TransactionId;
NetworkAccessTraffic
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where isnotempty(TransactionId)
| join kind=inner (genaiTx) on TransactionId
| summarize
    Requests = count(),
    Users = dcount(UserPrincipalName),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated),
    Actions = make_set(Action, 3)
    by CloudAppName, CloudAppCategory
| order by Requests desc
```

> `CloudAppCategory` may be empty in lightly-configured tenants — rely on `CloudAppName`. A newly-appearing `CloudAppName` (low `FirstSeen` recency, see Q9 pattern) is a candidate shadow-AI app to triage.

---

### Query 6: MCP Operation Overview

**Purpose:** The agent-side orientation. Breaks down MCP protocol activity by server (`DestinationUrl`), method (`SubActivity` = `initialize` / `tools/list` / `notifications/initialized` / `tools/call`), and direction (`EventType`). Shows which MCP servers agents are talking to and how heavily.  
**Severity:** Informational  
**MITRE:** TA0009, T1071.001

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "MCP protocol activity aggregation by server/method — not a detection."
-->

```kql

| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where Activity == "Mcp"

    Events = count(),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by DestinationUrl, SubActivity, EventType
| order by DestinationUrl asc, Events desc
```

---

### Query 7: MCP Tool-Call Inventory

**Purpose:** **The agent capability inventory.** Parses each `tools/call` request payload (`Content.params.name`) to enumerate exactly which MCP tools agents invoked, on which server. This is the *actual* tool usage on the wire — e.g. custom Sentinel data-exploration tools and Microsoft Learn tools.  
**Severity:** Low  
**MITRE:** T1530, T1071.001

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregated MCP tool-call inventory (parses Content.params.name) — investigation/posture pivot."
-->

```kql
NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where Activity == "Mcp" and SubActivity == "tools/call" and EventType == "Request"
| extend P = parse_json(Content)
| extend ToolName = tostring(P.params.name), Method = tostring(P.method)
| summarize
    Calls = count(),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated),
    Clients = make_set(McpClientName, 5)
    by DestinationUrl, ToolName
| order by Calls desc
```

> `Clients` may contain `"mcs"` (Copilot Studio) or empty strings. Use `DestinationUrl` as the authoritative server identifier — `McpServerName` is frequently empty.

---

### Query 8: Copilot Studio Agent — Attribute MCP Calls to the Agent

**Purpose:** Ties agent-side MCP `tools/call` activity (`NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights`) to the **traffic record** that identifies the agent (`NetworkAccessTraffic`), joined on `TransactionId`. Copilot Studio agent egress is identified by `HttpUserAgent startswith "CopilotStudio"`; the agent's schema name surfaces in `AIAgentName` (when populated). Produces an attributed timeline of which agent called which tool on which server.  
**Severity:** Low  
**MITRE:** T1078.004, T1071.001

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Cross-table agent attribution join (CopilotStudio user-agent ⋈ MCP tools/call on TransactionId) — investigation pivot."
-->

```kql
let mcpTx = NetworkAccessGenerativeAIInsights
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
    | where Activity == "Mcp" and SubActivity == "tools/call" and EventType == "Request"
    | project TransactionId, GaiTime = TimeGenerated,
              McpServerUrl = DestinationUrl,
              ToolName = tostring(parse_json(Content).params.name);
NetworkAccessTraffic
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where HttpUserAgent startswith "CopilotStudio"
| project TransactionId, TrafficTime = TimeGenerated,
          AgentName = AIAgentName, AgentId = AIAgentId,
          DestinationFqdn, Action, HttpUserAgent
| join kind=inner mcpTx on TransactionId
| project TrafficTime, AgentName, ToolName, McpServerUrl, DestinationFqdn, Action, HttpUserAgent
| order by TrafficTime desc
```

> `AIAgentName` holds the agent's **schema name** (e.g. `copilots_header_xxxxx`); it may be empty in some tenants, in which case `HttpUserAgent` is the reliable agent fingerprint. **This is the network-side view of the same tool calls** that [`agent365_observability.md`](../cloud/agent365_observability.md) sees from the agent runtime SDK — correlate by `ToolName` + time window to pair the two.

---

### Query 9: New MCP Server / Tool First-Seen vs 30-Day Baseline

**Purpose:** **Agent scope-drift / shadow-MCP detection.** Flags any (MCP server `DestinationUrl`, tool name) pair seen in the last day that was **absent** from the prior 30-day baseline. Catches a new MCP server appearing (every tool is new) and a new tool added on an existing server — possible unauthorized capability addition, agent drift, or a benign deployment change.  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** T1071.001, TA0011  
**Tuning Notes:** After legitimate agent/tool deployments, expect a transient first-seen spike. Maintain an allow-list join or temporarily lower severity after announced changes. Returns 0 rows in a steady-state tenant (no drift) — that is the expected clean result.

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true

adaptation_notes: "First-seen baseline detection. UserPrincipalName is often EMPTY on agent-initiated MCP rows (calls run under the agent identity) — AccountUpn is best-effort; the true entity is the MCP server URL (DestinationUrl), which is not an impactedAssets type. Schedule daily; uses a 30d baseline let-join (scheduled, not NRT)."
-->

    | distinct DestinationUrl, ToolName;

    by DestinationUrl, ToolName
| extend AccountUpn = tostring(Users[0])
| project FirstSeen, DestinationUrl, ToolName, Calls, AccountUpn
```

### Query 10: Prompt Content — Jailbreak Keyword Hunt

**Purpose:** Hunts prompt text for jailbreak / prompt-injection language **regardless of whether GSA blocked it** — catching attempts on apps that have no AI-prompt-inspection policy attached (the Q4 coverage gap). Row-level and suitable for a scheduled custom detection. Pair with Q3 (blocked) to separate *attempted-and-blocked* from *attempted-and-allowed*.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1078.004, T1567.002  
**Tuning Notes:** The regex covers common jailbreak phrasings (`ignore your instructions`, `system prompt`, `jailbreak`, `developer mode`, `do anything now`, etc.). Tune the pattern to your environment; expect occasional benign matches (security researchers, red-teamers). Each hit warrants reviewing the full `Content` and whether traffic was allowed (cross-ref Q3).

| project TimeGenerated, AccountUpn = UserPrincipalName, DestinationUrl, TransactionId,
          PromptPreview = substring(PromptText, 0, 300)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query 11: Connection-Level Context & Security Profile

**Purpose:** Enriches GenAI activity with **device and source-geo context** from `NetworkAccessConnectionEvents` (which has no `TransactionId`, so it is reached via `ConnectionId` → `NetworkAccessTraffic` → GenAI). Answers "from which device, OS, and location did this user reach the GenAI app, and which GSA security profile evaluated it?"  
**Severity:** Low

```

> `SecurityProfileName` may be empty if no GSA security profile is assigned to the matching rule. Broaden the `has_any` app filter to cover your sanctioned GenAI apps.

### Query 12: End-to-End Session Reconstruction

**Purpose:** Builds a single chronological timeline merging client prompts and agent MCP operations, each annotated with the `NetworkAccessTraffic` policy verdict (`Action` / `PolicyName` / `RuleName`). The IR pivot — reconstructs everything GSA saw for AI activity in the window. Scope to a user (`UserPrincipalName`) or a `TransactionId` for a focused timeline.

## Investigation Workflow

1. **Orient** — Q1 (activity split: prompts vs MCP), Q6 (MCP servers in use).
2. **Client / Prompt side** — Q2 (who prompts which app) → Q3 (blocked malicious prompts, the priority signal) → Q10 (jailbreak attempts incl. *allowed* ones) → Q4 (which apps lack a prompt-inspection policy) → Q5 (shadow-AI discovery).
3. **Agent / MCP side** — Q7 (tool-call inventory) → Q8 (attribute calls to the Copilot Studio agent) → Q9 (new MCP server/tool drift).
4. **Enrich & reconstruct** — Q11 (device + geo + security profile) → Q12 (end-to-end timeline for the flagged user/transaction).
5. **Correlate to the application layer** — for a flagged agent, pivot to [`agent365_observability.md`](../cloud/agent365_observability.md) for the runtime tool-call arguments; for Microsoft Copilot surfaces pivot to [`copilot_activity_investigation.md`](../cloud/copilot_activity_investigation.md).
