## Overview

`CopilotActivity` is the **all-surface AI activity table** — a unified audit record of every Microsoft Copilot and AI interaction across the tenant: M365 Copilot (Teams, Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, SharePoint, Loop), Security Copilot, Copilot Studio declarative agents, autonomous (agentic) flows, Edge/Bing, and admin-center plugin/PromptBook management. Populated by the **Microsoft Copilot** connector.

This file reconstructs AI activity for incident response using the **scope → context → signal** methodology described in the Microsoft Security blog [Reconstructing AI activity in investigations](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/06/09/reconstructing-ai-activity-investigations/) (2026-06-09):

| Phase | Question | Queries |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Scope** | *Who* used AI, *when*, on *which surface*, with *which model*? | Q1–Q3 |
| **Context** | *What data* did Copilot read, and *what tools/connectors* did agents invoke? | Q4–Q7 |
| **Signal** | What is *suspicious* — jailbreaks, anomalous volume, plugin/agent tampering? | Q8–Q11 |
| **Pivot** | Reconstruct a *single actor or agent* timeline end-to-end | Q12 |

### How `CopilotActivity` relates to the other AI tables

| Table | Scope | Platform | Use when |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| **`CopilotActivity`** (this file) | **All** Copilot/AI surfaces (M365, Security Copilot, Studio agents, autonomous) | AH ≤30d / Data Lake 90d | General AI-activity reconstruction, jailbreak/data-exposure hunting |
| `AgentsInfo` | Static **configuration** snapshots of declarative agents | AH only | Agent posture audit (access, data sources, tools as *configured*) — see `ai-agent-posture` skill |
| `UnifiedAgentObservability` | Agent 365 / A365 runtime tool-call telemetry | Data Lake only (`workspaceId: "default"`) | Deep agentic tool-call forensics — see `agent365_observability.md` |
| `CloudAppEvents` (`CopilotInteraction`) | Security Copilot subset via unified audit | AH / Data Lake | Security-Copilot-only views — see `security_copilot_utilization.md` |

**Decision rule:** Start here (`CopilotActivity`) for breadth across all AI surfaces. Drill into `AgentsInfo` for configuration posture, `UnifiedAgentObservability` for agentic tool-call depth.

### ⚠️ Critical Table Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Table name is `CopilotActivity`, NOT `LLMActivity`** | Microsoft Learn sample queries reference the table as `LLMActivity` (the Azure Monitor reference alias). In **Advanced Hunting and the Sentinel workspace the table is `CopilotActivity`** — querying `LLMActivity` returns `Failed to resolve table`. Substitute the name when adapting Learn samples. |
| **`TimeGenerated`, not `Timestamp`** | This is a Sentinel/LA table. Use `TimeGenerated` in **both** Advanced Hunting and Data Lake. Using `Timestamp` returns `Failed to resolve column`. |
| **AH ≤30d / Data Lake >30d** | For ≤30 days use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` (free). For >30 days use `query_lake` (Data Lake, 90d). AH silently truncates to 30d. |
| **`LLMEventData` must be parsed in AH before `mv-expand`** | `LLMEventData` is a dynamic column. In Advanced Hunting, sub-arrays (`Messages`, `AccessedResources`, `Contexts`, `Resource`) come through as strings — wrap with `parse_json(tostring(LLMEventData.X))` **before** `mv-expand`, or you get `expanded expression expected to have dynamic type`. |
| **Schema differs by `RecordType` / `AppHost`** | The shape of `LLMEventData.AccessedResources` depends on the record type: **`CopilotInteraction`** → file/data reads (`SiteUrl`, `Type` = `docx`/`pdf`/`xlsx`/`EmailMessage`/`CITATION`) AND Defender runtime-protection evaluations (`Type` = `SecurityWebhook`). **`Autonomous`** (agentic) → connector/MCP tool invocations (`Type` = `Connector`). Always filter by `RecordType`/`AppHost` first, then extract the shape you expect. |
| **`Contexts.Type` is frequently EMPTY** | For many `CopilotInteraction` records (notably Security Copilot), `Contexts[]` contains only `Id` (e.g. the app origin URL) with an empty `Type`. **Real resource/data access lives in `AccessedResources[]`, not `Contexts[]`.** Do not rely on `Contexts.Type` for data-exposure analysis. |
| **`AgentId`/`AgentName` only populated for declarative agents** | These are the join keys to `AgentsInfo.AgentId` (a guid). They are empty for plain M365 Copilot chat. Filter `isnotempty(AgentId)` when correlating to configured agents. `AgentsInfo` also exposes `ObservabilityID` for runtime correlation. |
| **Synthetic service identities & egress IPs dominate volume** | Security Copilot generates high-volume synthetic actors (e.g. `SecurityCopilotAgentUser-*` UPNs) and on-behalf-of egress from fixed Azure IPs. These dwarf human activity in count-based queries. **Filter them out** before anomaly/volume analysis (see Q9) or they produce false positives. |
| **Compliance violations live in `DataSecurityEvents`, not `CopilotActivity`** | `CopilotActivity` records *that* an interaction happened and *what resources* it touched, but it does not classify content sensitivity or policy violations. Purview-derived signals — risky prompts, sensitive responses, DLP alerts, label downgrades, inappropriate/regulated content — are emitted to **`DataSecurityEvents`** (AH-only, requires Insider Risk Management opt-in). The Hunt Playbook below pairs the two tables; see Q13 and the `data-security-analysis` skill. |

## 🎯 Hunt Playbook — 7-Day Broad Sweep

**Trigger:** *"Hunt Copilot activity over the last Nd and surface any threats or violations to look into."* Run the steps below in order — steps 1–6 are the broad sweep; the pivot reconstructs any actor or agent that trips a trigger. All steps default to a 7-day window in Advanced Hunting (≤30d); for >30d switch to Data Lake.

| Step | Query | What it surfaces | Escalate when | Pivot |
|------|-------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| 0 | Q1 | Baseline — where AI activity is concentrated (surface × workload) | Orientation only | — |
| 1 | **Q8** | Jailbreak / prompt injection attempts | **Any row** | Q12 + Q4 on the actor |
| 2 | **Q13** | Compliance violations (risky prompts, sensitive responses, DLP, label downgrade, regulated/inappropriate content) | Label-downgrade, financial/regulatory, or inappropriate-content rows; any single user spiking | `data-security-analysis` skill; Q12 on the user |
| 3 | **Q9** | Anomalous interaction volume per user (scripted abuse / exfil-via-AI) | Burst above tuned threshold; use off-hours variant for after-hours activity | Q4 + Q12 on the actor |
| 4 | **Q10** | Plugin / agent lifecycle tampering (enable/disable/delete) | Change by an unexpected actor, or a security plugin disabled | `ai-agent-posture` skill on the `AgentId` |
| 5 | **Q11** | PromptBook tampering | Any unexpected create/update/delete | Confirm against admin change records |
| 6 | **Q6** | Runtime tool-protection gaps (`FailClose = False`) | A sensitive tool evaluated but not fail-close | Q5 + `ai-agent-posture` skill |

**Pivot (any trigger):** Q12 reconstructs the actor's full AI timeline; Q4 shows what data their interactions accessed; for a flagged `AgentId`, cross to the `ai-agent-posture` skill to compare runtime behavior against configuration.

**What "clean" looks like:** Q8 returns 0 rows; Q13 shows only baseline risky-prompt / sensitive-response volume with no label-downgrade or regulated-content hits; Q9 shows no bursts above baseline; Q10/Q11 show only changes by known makers/admins; Q6 shows fail-close enforced on sensitive tools.

**Noise to expect:** `SecurityCopilotAgentUser-*` synthetic actors and on-behalf-of Security Copilot egress dominate raw counts — already filtered in Q9; apply the same filter when adapting other steps. `DataSecurityEvents` is dominated by high-volume *Risky prompt entered in Copilot* / *Sensitive response received in Copilot* events — focus on the rarer, higher-signal ActionTypes (label downgrade, regulated content, inappropriate content, agent generating sensitive responses).

## Queries

### Query 1: AI Surface Overview

**Purpose:** Baseline of all AI activity across surfaces — the first query in any AI investigation. Shows volume by record type, hosting app, and workload so you know where activity is concentrated before drilling in.  
**Severity:** Informational  
**MITRE:** TA0007

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Statistical posture overview (summarize by surface) — not a detection."
-->

```kql
CopilotActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize
    Events = count(),
    Actors = dcount(ActorName),
    Agents = dcountif(AgentId, isnotempty(AgentId)),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by RecordType, AppHost, Workload
| order by Events desc
```

---

### Query 2: Copilot Interactions by User

**Purpose:** Per-user interaction counts and activity window — establishes who is using Copilot and how heavily. Adapted from the Microsoft Learn sample (table renamed `LLMActivity` → `CopilotActivity`).  
**Severity:** Informational  
**MITRE:** TA0007

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Per-user aggregation baseline — not a detection."

```kql
CopilotActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)

    Surfaces = make_set(AppHost, 10),
    FirstInteraction = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastInteraction = max(TimeGenerated)
    by ActorName, ActorUserId, ActorUserType
| order by InteractionCount desc
```

---

### Query 3: AI Model Usage Statistics

**Purpose:** Which AI models/versions are in use, and by how many distinct users — useful for governance and for spotting an unexpected model appearing in the tenant. Adapted from the Microsoft Learn sample.  
**Severity:** Informational  
**MITRE:** TA0007

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Model inventory aggregation — not a detection."
-->

```kql
CopilotActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where RecordType == "CopilotInteraction"
| where isnotempty(AIModelName)
| summarize
    InteractionCount = count(),
    UniqueUsers = dcount(ActorUserId),
    FirstUsed = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastUsed = max(TimeGenerated)
    by AIModelName, AIModelVersion
| order by InteractionCount desc
```

---

### Query 4: Data Accessed by Copilot

**Purpose:** **The data-exposure dimension.** Reconstructs which files, documents, and messages Copilot read on behalf of users (OneDrive/SharePoint files, emails, citations). Critical for "what could the AI have seen?" during an IR. Note `AccessedResources` holds the real resource access — `Contexts` is unreliable (see pitfalls).  
**Severity:** Low  
**MITRE:** T1213, T1530

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregated data-access inventory by resource type — investigation pivot, not a row-level detection."
-->

```kql
CopilotActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where RecordType == "CopilotInteraction"
| extend AR = parse_json(tostring(LLMEventData.AccessedResources))
| mv-expand AR
| where isnotempty(tostring(AR.SiteUrl)) or tostring(AR.Type) in ("EmailMessage", "CITATION")
| extend
    ResourceType = tostring(AR.Type),
    Action = tostring(AR.Action),
    ResourceUrl = tostring(AR.SiteUrl)
| where ResourceType != "SecurityWebhook"   // runtime-protection evals handled in Q6
| summarize
    AccessCount = count(),
    Users = dcount(ActorName),
    Surfaces = make_set(AppHost, 5)
    by ResourceType, Action
| order by AccessCount desc
```

> To pivot to a specific user's accessed files, add `| where ActorName =~ "user@contoso.com"` after the first `where`, and project `ResourceUrl` instead of summarizing.

---

### Query 5: Autonomous Agent Runtime Tool Invocations

**Purpose:** For **agentic / autonomous** Copilot flows, `AccessedResources` records each connector/MCP tool the agent invoked at runtime (`Type = Connector`). This reveals the *actual* capabilities an autonomous agent exercised — e.g. mail, calendar, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams MCP servers — as opposed to what it was merely *configured* with (`AgentsInfo`).  
**Severity:** Low  
**MITRE:** T1530, T1071.001

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Aggregated runtime tool inventory for autonomous agents — investigation pivot."
-->

```kql
CopilotActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where AppHost == "Autonomous"
| extend AR = parse_json(tostring(LLMEventData.AccessedResources))
| mv-expand AR
| extend
    ToolName = tostring(AR.Name),
    ToolAction = tostring(AR.Action),
    ResourceType = tostring(AR.Type)
| where isnotempty(ToolName) or isnotempty(ToolAction)
| summarize
    Invocations = count(),
    Actors = dcount(ActorName),
    Agents = make_set(AgentName, 10)
    by ToolName, ToolAction, ResourceType
| order by Invocations desc
```

---

### Query 6: Defender Runtime Protection — Tool Evaluations

**Purpose:** When **Defender Runtime Protection** is enabled, each agent tool invocation is evaluated by a security webhook, and the evaluation is recorded in `AccessedResources` with `Type = SecurityWebhook`. This query parses the evaluation string to surface **which tools were inspected, their tool type, and the fail-close posture** — the runtime counterpart to the `ai-agent-posture` skill's configuration audit. A tool evaluated but *not* fail-close is an exposure gap.  
**Severity:** Low  
**MITRE:** TA0009, T1071.001

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Parses runtime-protection evaluation strings into a tool inventory — investigation/posture, not a row-level detection."
-->

```kql
CopilotActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where RecordType == "CopilotInteraction"
| extend AR = parse_json(tostring(LLMEventData.AccessedResources))
| mv-expand AR
| where tostring(AR.Type) == "SecurityWebhook"
| extend EvalText = tostring(AR.Action)
| extend
    ToolName = extract(@"Evaluated tool name: ([^,]+)", 1, EvalText),
    ToolType = extract(@"Evaluated tool type: ([^,]+)", 1, EvalText),
    FailClose = extract(@"Fail close configuration is set to: (\w+)", 1, EvalText),
    Reason = extract(@"Reason: ([^,]+)", 1, EvalText)
| summarize
    Evaluations = count(),
    Actors = dcount(ActorName),
    Agents = make_set(AgentName, 10)
    by ToolName, ToolType, FailClose
| order by Evaluations desc
```

> `ToolType` values observed: `PrebuiltToolDefinition`, `DynamicServerToolDefinition` (MCP server tools), `ToolDefinition`. `FailClose = False` means the agent would proceed even if the security evaluation could not complete — review these tools.

---

### Query 7: Declarative Agent Adoption

**Purpose:** Bridges configuration and runtime. Lists declarative agents (by `AgentId`/`AgentName`) that actually produced activity, with their user reach and surfaces. Join `AgentId` to `AgentsInfo.AgentId` to find **configured-but-dormant** agents (in `AgentsInfo`, absent here) and **active** agents (present here) — see the `ai-agent-posture` skill Phase 5.  
**Severity:** Informational  
**MITRE:** TA0007

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Agent adoption posture aggregation — not a detection."
-->

```kql
CopilotActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where isnotempty(AgentId)
| summarize
    Events = count(),
    Users = dcount(ActorName),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated),
    Surfaces = make_set(AppHost, 5),
    RecordTypes = make_set(RecordType, 5)
    by AgentName, AgentId
| order by Events desc
```

---

### Query 8: Jailbreak / Prompt Injection Detection

**Purpose:** Surfaces interactions where the platform flagged a **jailbreak / prompt-injection attempt** (`Messages[].JailbreakDetected == true`). This is the highest-value security signal in `CopilotActivity`. Row-level and suitable for a scheduled custom detection. Adapted from the Microsoft Learn sample with the AH `parse_json(tostring(...))` fix.  
**Severity:** High  
**MITRE:** T1078.004, T1059  
**Tuning Notes:** True positives are rare (often single-digit per month in normal tenants). Each hit warrants review of the full prompt and the actor's broader activity (Q12).

    JailbreakDetected = tobool(Messages.JailbreakDetected)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query 9: Anomalous Copilot Volume per User-Hour

**Purpose:** Detects a single human actor generating an unusually high burst of Copilot interactions in one hour — possible scripted abuse, data-harvesting via Copilot, or a compromised account exfiltrating through AI. **Filters out synthetic Security Copilot service identities** which otherwise dominate (see pitfalls).  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** TA0009, T1530  
**Tuning Notes:** Tune the `> 50` threshold to the tenant's baseline. Heavy legitimate Copilot users may approach it; combine with `Q12` to confirm intent.

| where EventCount > 50
| order by EventCount desc
```

> **Off-hours variant (Hunt Playbook step 3):** to surface after-hours bursts specifically, swap the per-hour summarize for an off-hours per-day window. Tune the hour boundary and `> 30` threshold to the tenant. (`ActorUserType` is `Regular` for all rows in many tenants, so do **not** rely on it for a guest filter.)

> | where EventCount > 30
> | order by EventCount desc
> ```

### Query 10: Plugin Lifecycle Management Activity

**Purpose:** Tracks creation, update, enable, disable, and deletion of Copilot plugins/agents — a governance and tampering signal. An attacker (or rogue maker) enabling a high-privilege plugin or disabling a security plugin shows up here. Adapted from the Microsoft Learn sample.  
**Severity:** Medium  
**MITRE:** T1078.004, TA0003  
**Tuning Notes:** Correlate the actor against expected Copilot Studio makers/admins.

| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

---

### Query 11: PromptBook Management Activity

**Purpose:** Tracks creation, update, and deletion of Security Copilot PromptBooks. PromptBooks codify multi-step prompt workflows; unexpected changes can indicate tampering with automated security workflows. Adapted from the Microsoft Learn sample with the AH `parse_json(tostring(...))` fix.  
**Severity:** Low  
**MITRE:** TA0003  
**Tuning Notes:** Low-volume in most tenants; review each change against expected admin activity.

| project TimeGenerated, ActorName, RecordType, PromptBookId, SrcIpAddr, AppHost
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query 12: Single-Actor AI Activity Timeline

**Purpose:** **The pivot query.** Reconstructs one actor's complete AI activity timeline across all surfaces — interactions, agents used, models, source IPs, and jailbreak flags — for a focused investigation. Substitute the target UPN.  
**Severity:** Informational  
**MITRE:** TA0007, TA0009

### Query 13: Copilot Compliance Violations

**Purpose:** **The compliance/violation dimension** of the Hunt Playbook. `CopilotActivity` does not classify content sensitivity — Purview emits Copilot policy signals to **`DataSecurityEvents`**. This query triages those signals by ActionType so you can spot the high-value violations (sensitivity-label downgrade then Copilot access, regulated/financial content, inappropriate content, agents generating sensitive responses) above the baseline risky-prompt / sensitive-response noise. For deep DLP/SIT/label analysis, hand off to the `data-security-analysis` skill.  
**Severity:** Medium (varies by ActionType — label downgrade and regulated content are higher)  
**MITRE:** T1213, T1567.002, TA0010  
**Tuning Notes:** *Risky prompt entered in Copilot* and *Sensitive response received in Copilot* are extremely high-volume baseline events — keep them for trend context but focus triage on the rarer ActionTypes. Requires Insider Risk Management opt-in; returns 0 rows if not enabled.

<!-- cd-metadata

    or ActionType has "Agent generating"

    Users = dcount(AccountUpn),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by ActionType
| order by Events asc   // rarest (highest-signal) violations first
```

> **Per-user drill-down:** to pivot to who is generating a specific violation, add `| where ActionType has "Label on file"` (or the ActionType of interest) and `summarize ... by AccountUpn` instead. Then run Q12 on that UPN for the full AI timeline.

## Investigation Workflow

1. **Scope** — Run Q1 to map where AI activity is concentrated, then Q2/Q3 to identify heavy users and models in play.
2. **Context** — Run Q4 to see what data Copilot read; Q5 for autonomous-agent tool invocations; Q6 for Defender runtime-protection evaluations; Q7 to map active declarative agents.
3. **Signal** — Run Q8 (jailbreak) as the priority security signal, Q13 for compliance violations, Q9 for volume anomalies, Q10/Q11 for plugin/PromptBook tampering.
4. **Pivot** — For any flagged actor, run Q12 to reconstruct their full AI timeline, then cross-reference accessed resources (Q4 scoped to the actor).
5. **Correlate to configuration** — For any flagged `AgentId`, pivot to the `ai-agent-posture` skill (`AgentsInfo`) to compare runtime behavior against configured access, data sources, and tools.

> **Just want the broad sweep?** Use the [Hunt Playbook — 7-Day Broad Sweep](#-hunt-playbook--7-day-broad-sweep) near the top — it sequences the signal queries (Q8 → Q13 → Q9 → Q10/Q11 → Q6) with escalation triggers and pivots.
