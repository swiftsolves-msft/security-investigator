## ⚠️ CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️

**🤖 SKILL DETECTION:** Before starting any investigation, check the [Available Skills](#available-skills) section below and load the appropriate SKILL.md file.

---

## 🔧 ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION

**Environment-specific values (workspace IDs, tenant IDs, resource group names) are stored in `config.json` at the workspace root.** This file is gitignored and never committed.

When you need environment values (especially for Azure MCP Server calls), **read `config.json`** instead of asking the user or hardcoding values.

**`config.json` Schema** (see `config.json.template` for field names):

| Field | Used By | Purpose |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `sentinel_workspace_id` | Sentinel Data Lake MCP (`query_lake`) | Log Analytics workspace GUID |
| `tenant_id` | All Azure/Sentinel tools | Entra ID tenant |
| `subscription_id` | Azure MCP Server, Azure CLI | Azure subscription |
| `azure_mcp.resource_group` | Azure MCP `workspace_log_query` | RG containing Log Analytics workspace |
| `azure_mcp.workspace_name` | Azure MCP `workspace_log_query` | Log Analytics workspace display name |
| `azure_mcp.tenant` | Azure MCP Server (all calls) | Required to avoid cross-tenant auth errors |
| `azure_mcp.subscription` | Azure MCP Server (all calls) | Target subscription |

**API Tokens (`.env` file):** Enrichment API tokens are stored in `.env` (gitignored), loaded via `python-dotenv`. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in your keys.

| Environment Variable | Used By | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|--------|
| `IPINFO_TOKEN` | `enrich_ips.py` | ipinfo.io API key |
| `ABUSEIPDB_TOKEN` | `enrich_ips.py` | AbuseIPDB API key |
| `VPNAPI_TOKEN` | `enrich_ips.py` | vpnapi.io API key |
| `SHODAN_TOKEN` | `enrich_ips.py` | Shodan API key |

> **Fallback:** `enrich_ips.py` also reads `ipinfo_token`/`abuseipdb_token`/`vpnapi_token`/`shodan_token` from `config.json` if the environment variables are not set. `.env` takes precedence.

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Required By | Setup |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Azure CLI** (`az`) | Azure MCP Server (underlying auth), `sentinel-ingestion-report` skill (`az rest` for rule inventory, `az monitor` for tier classification) | Install: [aka.ms/installazurecli](https://aka.ms/installazurecli). Authenticate: `az login --tenant <tenant_id>`. Set subscription: `az account set --subscription <subscription_id>` |

> **Note:** Individual skills may have additional CLI dependencies documented in their own SKILL.md files. Check the skill file for skill-specific requirements before running a workflow.

**When making Azure MCP Server calls**, always pass `tenant` and `subscription` from `config.json` to avoid the multi-tenant auth issue (DefaultAzureCredential may pick up the wrong tenant).

## 🔴 SENTINEL WORKSPACE SELECTION - GLOBAL RULE

**This rule applies to ALL skills and ALL Sentinel queries. Follow STRICTLY.**

When executing ANY Sentinel query (via the Sentinel Data Lake `query_lake` MCP tool):

### Workspace Selection Flow

1. **BEFORE first query:** Call `list_sentinel_workspaces()` to enumerate available workspaces
2. **If exactly 1 workspace:** Auto-select, display to user, proceed
3. **If multiple workspaces AND no prior selection in session:**
   - Display ALL workspaces with Name and ID
   - ASK user: "Which Sentinel workspace should I use for this investigation? Select one or more, or 'all'."
   - **⛔ STOP AND WAIT** for explicit user response
   - **⛔ DO NOT proceed until user selects**
4. **If query fails on selected workspace:**
   - **⛔ STOP IMMEDIATELY**
   - Report: "⚠️ Query failed on [WORKSPACE_NAME]. Error: [ERROR_MESSAGE]"
   - Display available workspaces
   - ASK user to select a different workspace
   - **⛔ DO NOT automatically retry with another workspace**

### 🔴 PROHIBITED ACTIONS

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Auto-selecting workspace when multiple exist | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Switching workspaces after query failure without asking | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Proceeding with ambiguous workspace context | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Assuming workspace from previous conversation turns | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Making any workspace decision on behalf of user | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |

### ✅ REQUIRED ACTIONS

| Scenario | Required Action |
|----------|----------------|
| Multiple workspaces, none selected | STOP, list all, ASK user, WAIT |
| Query fails with table/workspace error | STOP, report error, ASK user, WAIT |
| Single workspace available | Auto-select, DISPLAY to user, proceed |
| Workspace already selected in session | Reuse selection, DISPLAY which workspace is being used |

## 🔴 KQL QUERY & HUNT EXECUTION - PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

**This checklist applies to EVERY KQL query, hunt, search, or data lookup — whether the user said "query", "hunt", "search", "look for", "find", "do we have X", "is there any Y", or just pasted an IoC/keyword/tool name.**

**🔴 MANDATORY FIRST ACTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** Before the first `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` or `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` tool call of a conversation turn, you MUST complete Step 1 (discovery manifest + grep of `queries/**` and `.github/skills/**`). If you are about to write a KQL query and have not yet done a Priority 1 or Priority 2 discovery check for the user's keyword/topic, **STOP and do the discovery first**. A "hunt for X" request is NEVER an exception — it is the exact scenario the manifest exists to serve.

**Self-check before every KQL tool call:** *"Did I grep_search `queries/**` for the user's keyword (tool name, IoC, threat name, table, operation) in this turn?"* If no → STOP, do the discovery, then resume.

**Exception — Skill & query library queries:** When following a SKILL.md investigation workflow or using a query directly from the `queries/` library, the queries are already verified and battle-tested. Skip Steps 1–4 and use those queries directly (substituting entity values as instructed). Step 0 (tool selection) and Step 5 (sanity-check zero results) still apply. *Note: "I already know the keyword" does NOT qualify as this exception — you must have actually located the query file.*

Before writing or executing any **ad-hoc KQL query or hunt** (i.e., not already from a SKILL.md file or `queries/` file), complete these steps **in order**:

### Step 0: Pick the Right Tool for the Lookback Window

**Check the user's requested lookback against tool retention before writing KQL:**

| Lookback | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| **≤ 30 days** | `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` (AH) | Default; free for Analytics-tier tables |
| **> 30 days** (31d, 60d, 90d, "last quarter", date ranges >30d) | `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` (Data Lake) | AH Graph API silently truncates results to 30d — no error, no warning. Using AH for 90d under-reports days 31–90. |

**Self-check before every KQL tool call:** *"If lookback > 30 days, am I on Data Lake?"* If not, switch.

**Timestamp adaptation when switching AH → Data Lake:**
- XDR-native tables (`Device*`, `Email*`, `Cloud*`, `Alert*`, `Identity*`, `Entra*`): change `Timestamp` → `TimeGenerated`
- Sentinel/LA tables (`SigninLogs`, `AuditLogs`, `SecurityAlert`, etc.): already use `TimeGenerated` in both tools
- Column name differences (e.g., `EntraIdSignInEvents.AccountUpn` ↔ `SigninLogs.UserPrincipalName`): see the EntraIdSignInEvents row in Step 3

### Step 1: Check for Existing Verified Queries (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

| Priority | Source | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 1st | **Discovery manifest** (`.github/manifests/discovery-manifest.yaml`) | Read the manifest and match by **domain tag** (e.g., `identity`, `endpoint`, `email`) or **MITRE technique ID** (e.g., `T1078`, `T1566`). The manifest indexes all query files and skills with `title`, `path`, `domains`, `mitre`, and `prompt` fields. Best when you know the security domain or ATT&CK technique — skips scanning individual files. |
| 2nd | **Targeted `grep_search`** (skills + queries) | `grep_search` for the **specific table name** (e.g., `CloudAppEvents`, `OfficeActivity`) or **operation keyword** (e.g., `New-InboxRule`, `SecretGet`) scoped to `queries/**` and `.github/skills/**`. The manifest lacks table-name and keyword fields — grep fills this gap for table-specific lookups. |
| 3rd | **This file's Appendix** | Check [Ad-Hoc Query Examples](#appendix-ad-hoc-query-examples) for canonical patterns (SecurityAlert→SecurityIncident join, AuditLogs best practices, etc.) |
| 4th | **KQL Search MCP** | Use `search_github_examples_fallback` or `validate_kql_query` for community-published examples |
| 5th | **Microsoft Learn MCP** | Use `microsoft_code_sample_search` with `language: "kusto"` for official examples |

**When to use which:** If you know the **domain** ("identity threat") or **MITRE technique** (T1078) → start with Priority 1 (manifest). If you know the **table name** (`AuditLogs`) or **specific operation** (`Set-Mailbox`) → start with Priority 2 (grep). Both can be used together — manifest for breadth, grep for precision.

**Short-circuit rule:** If a suitable query is found in Priority 1 (manifest), Priority 2 (grep), or Priority 3 (Appendix), skip Steps 2–4 and use it directly (substituting entity values). These sources are already schema-verified and pitfall-aware. Step 5 (sanity-check zero results) still applies.

### Step 2: Verify Table Schema

Before querying any table for the first time in a session, verify the schema:
- Use `search_tables` or `get_table_schema` from KQL Search MCP
- Confirm column names, types, and which columns contain GUIDs vs human-readable values
- Check if the table exists in Data Lake vs Advanced Hunting (see [Tool Selection Rule](#-tool-selection-rule-data-lake-vs-advanced-hunting))
- **⚠️ Column name hallucination:** LLMs frequently use column names from one table on a different table. Common confusions: `Severity` vs `AlertSeverity` (SecurityIncident vs SecurityAlert), `OS` vs `OSPlatform` (Device* tables), `IPAddress` vs `RemoteIP` (varies by table), `Entities` (SecurityAlert only — not on SecurityIncident). Always verify the column exists on the specific table being queried.

### Step 3: Check Known Table Pitfalls

**Review this quick-reference before querying these tables:**

| Table | Pitfall | Required Action |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **ALL Sentinel/LA tables** (SigninLogs, AuditLogs, SecurityAlert, SecurityIncident, OfficeActivity, etc.) | Column is **`TimeGenerated`**, NOT `Timestamp`. Using `Timestamp` on these tables returns `SemanticError: Failed to resolve column`. This is the **#1 most frequent Data Lake MCP error**. LLMs default to `Timestamp` from AH query patterns | **Data Lake:** Always `TimeGenerated`. **Advanced Hunting:** `Timestamp` for XDR-native tables (Device\*, Email\*, Cloud\*, Alert\*, Identity\*), `TimeGenerated` for Sentinel/LA tables. When adapting AH queries for Data Lake: replace ALL `Timestamp` → `TimeGenerated` |
| **AADRiskySignIns** | Table does **NOT exist** in Sentinel Data Lake. Querying it returns `SemanticError: Failed to resolve table` | Use `AADUserRiskEvents` instead (contains Identity Protection risk detections). For sign-in-level risk data, use `SigninLogs` with `RiskLevelDuringSignIn` and `RiskState` columns |
| **AADUserRiskEvents** | May have different retention than SigninLogs. **IP column is `IpAddress`** (lowercase 'p'), NOT `IPAddress`. Using `IPAddress` returns `Failed to resolve scalar expression`. LLMs default to `IPAddress` (matching SigninLogs convention) and consistently get this wrong. **Timestamp column is `ActivityDateTime`**, NOT `TimeGenerated` — using `TimeGenerated` silently returns 0 results (column exists but is ingestion time, not event time). `Location` is a **JSON string** — use `parse_json(Location).countryOrRegion` | Cross-reference with `SigninLogs` `RiskLevelDuringSignIn` for complete picture. Always use `IpAddress` (lowercase 'p') and `ActivityDateTime` for time filtering |
| **AADUserRiskEvents** | **`suspiciousAuthAppApproval` naming trap:** Despite the name, this detection is about **MFA Authenticator push approval patterns** (MITRE T1621 — MFA Request Generation / MFA Fatigue), **NOT** OAuth app consent grants. LLMs consistently misinterpret this as app registration/consent abuse and incorrectly recommend `app-registration-posture` audits. The `AdditionalInfo` field contains `"mitreTechniques": "T1621"` confirming MFA focus. No corresponding entries appear in AuditLogs consent operations | When `suspiciousAuthAppApproval` appears: investigate MFA patterns and sign-in anomalies (`user-investigation`, `authentication-tracing`). **NEVER** recommend `app-registration-posture` or search for OAuth consent grants based solely on this risk event |
| **AgentsInfo** | **Advanced Hunting only** — does NOT exist in Sentinel Data Lake. Replaces the deprecated `AIAgentsInfo` (queryable until **July 1, 2026**); this is a **different data model**, not a rename. Multiple snapshot records per agent; key is **`AgentId` (guid)**, columns are **`Name`/`Description`** (NOT `AgentName`/`AgentDescription`). The normalized columns (`DeclaredTools`, `McpServers`, `DeclaredDataSources`) are **sparse and flat**; the rich detail lives in **`RawAgentInfo`** (dynamic, populated for ~all agents) and `RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata` (DCM, only ~10% of agents). **No authentication-type column** — `ToolsAuthenticationType` is empty; the old `UserAuthenticationType` has no equivalent. `Availability`, `Endpoints`, `Triggers`, `Permissions`, `Model` are also empty in practice. AH booleans are textual (`"true"`/`"false"`) | Always use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`. Deduplicate with `summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId`. Exclude deleted with `where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"` (blank = active). Creator: `tostring(RawAgentInfo.creatorId)` (GUID → join `IdentityInfo` on `AccountObjectId`). Broad-access proxy: `tostring(RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers) == "true"` (use instead of "unauthenticated"). Deep capability/endpoint detail: parse `RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata[].actions[].apis[]` (`.type`, `.serverUrls[]` for OpenApi/RemoteMCPServer only, `.operations[].operationId`) — state the DCM coverage caveat. Use the `ai-agent-posture` skill for full posture reports |
| **AuditLogs** | `InitiatedBy`, `TargetResources` are **dynamic fields** | Always wrap in `tostring()` before using `has` operator |
| **AuditLogs** | `OperationName` values vary across providers — e.g., "Reset user password", "Change user password", "Self-service password reset" are all different values. **Consent lifecycle trap:** `"Consent to application"` is only 1 of 4+ operations. `has_any()` requires exact word matches and is unpredictable | Use broad `has "keyword"` for discovery (e.g., `has "password"`, `has "role"`), then refine with `summarize count() by OperationName`. For consent investigations use `queries/identity/app_credential_management.md` Query 5 which has the complete operation list |
| **AzureDiagnostics** | **Legacy table** — Microsoft [explicitly documents](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/datalake/kql-queries#query-considerations-and-limitations) that "Querying legacy tables such as AzureDiagnostics is not supported" in Data Lake. `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` returns `SemanticError: Failed to resolve table` even though the table exists in the workspace. Lake-only ingestion is also not supported (`No` in [connector reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/sentinel-tables-connectors-reference)). The portal may show the workspace as "Data Lake integrated" but individual tables have eligibility flags — this table is stuck on Analytics tier. This is NOT the same table as `AzureActivity`. **AzureDiagnostics** = resource-specific diagnostic logs (Key Vault data plane: `SecretGet`, `Authentication`, `VaultGet`; SQL auditing; Firewall logs; App Service logs, etc.). **AzureActivity** = ARM control plane operations (resource creation/deletion, policy actions, role assignments, deployments). Confusing the two leads to querying the wrong table and missing critical data plane evidence | If Data Lake returns "Failed to resolve table", **immediately** try `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` (AH can query Analytics-tier tables). Do NOT fall back to `AzureActivity` — it contains completely different data. Key columns: `ResourceType` (e.g., `VAULTS`), `OperationName` (e.g., `SecretGet`), `CallerIPAddress`, `ResultType`, `Resource` (resource name), `Category` (e.g., `AuditEvent`). Filter pattern: `AzureDiagnostics \| where ResourceType == "VAULTS" \| where Resource =~ "<vault-name>"`. For Key Vault investigations, look for `OperationName` values like `SecretGet`, `SecretList`, `Authentication`, `VaultGet` |
| **BehaviorEntities / BehaviorInfo** | **Advanced Hunting only** — does NOT exist in Sentinel Data Lake. Table is in **Preview**. Two companion tables: `BehaviorInfo` (1 row per behavior — description, MITRE techniques, time window) and `BehaviorEntities` (N rows per behavior — entity decomposition). Populated by **MCAS** and **Sentinel UEBA** only — if these services aren't deployed, queries return 0 rows. `Categories` and `AttackTechniques` are **JSON strings**, not arrays — must `parse_json()` before `mv-expand`. K8s entity `AdditionalFields` contains deeply nested JSON with `$id`/`$ref` circular references. Low volume table (behavioral detections, not raw events). Significant overlap with SecurityAlert (same MCAS/MDC sources) but provides **below-alert-threshold signals** and **pre-decomposed entity rows** without parsing the SecurityAlert `Entities` JSON blob | Always use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`. Join tables on `BehaviorId`. Key ActionTypes: `ImpossibleTravelActivity`, `MultipleFailedLoginAttempts`, `MassDownload`, `UnusualAdditionOfCredentialsToAnOauthApp`, `K8S.NODE_DriftBlocked`, `K8S.NODE_MalwareBlocked`. Entity rows have `EntityRole` = `Impacted` or `Related`. Use for enriching user/IP investigations with MCAS/UEBA context. See `queries/cloud/behavior_entities.md` for verified query patterns |
| **CloudAppEvents** | **Extremely high-volume table** — ingests ALL M365 unified audit events (mail reads, file access, Teams, admin ops, etc.). Queries without selective early filters will timeout or get cancelled. **`RawEventData` is a large JSON blob** (often 5-100+ KB per row). **Performance killer #1:** `tostring(RawEventData) has "value"` — forces full JSON serialization on every row before substring search. **Performance killer #2:** Repeated `parse_json(RawEventData)` calls in separate `extend` statements — re-parses the entire blob per call. **Performance killer #3:** `AccountDisplayName has "partial"` — substring match without index; use `AccountObjectId` (GUID, indexed) or `AccountDisplayName =~` (exact, case-insensitive). **`AccountId` is a GUID (Entra ObjectId), NOT a UPN** — filtering `AccountId in~ ("user@domain.com")` returns 0 results silently. Use `AccountObjectId` (identical GUID) for indexed lookups, or `AccountDisplayName` for display-name-based filtering. To filter by UPN, resolve to ObjectId first via Graph API: `GET /v1.0/users/<UPN>?$select=id`. **`ApplicationId` is `int`, NOT `string`** — this is a Defender-internal integer, NOT the Entra AppId GUID. Using string GUID arrays with `in` operator returns `SEM0025: type mismatch`. To resolve app names from Entra GUID AppIds, use `SigninLogs`/`AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` (which have `AppId` as string + `AppDisplayName`), or `OAuthAppInfo` (which uses `OAuthAppId` as string). **Inbox rule queries:** For `New-InboxRule`/`Set-InboxRule`/`Set-Mailbox`, **ALWAYS also query `OfficeActivity`** (Exchange workload) — these tables are **complementary, not alternatives**. `CloudAppEvents` provides ActionType-based summaries and `AccountDisplayName`, but `OfficeActivity` provides the full `Parameters` JSON (forwarding targets: `ForwardTo`, `RedirectTo`, `ForwardingSmtpAddress`), per-operation `ClientIP`, and additional Exchange audit operations (`MoveToDeletedItems`, `MailItemsAccessed`, `Send`) critical for post-compromise forensics. When investigating mailbox manipulation, query BOTH tables. `ActionType` is CamelCase — use `contains` not `has` for partial matching (e.g., `ActionType contains "Sentinel"` not `has`) | **Filter order:** `Timestamp`/`TimeGenerated` first → `ActionType` (most selective, eliminates 99%+ rows) → identity filter (`AccountObjectId` preferred). **RawEventData:** Parse ONCE with `extend ParsedData = parse_json(RawEventData)` (or `parse_json(tostring(RawEventData))` in AH), then extract all fields from `ParsedData`. NEVER use `tostring(RawEventData) has "x"` for filtering — extract the specific field instead. **For inbox rule investigations, query BOTH:** (1) `CloudAppEvents` for ActionType summary + identity context, (2) `OfficeActivity \| where OfficeWorkload == "Exchange"` for full Parameters JSON, ClientIP, and additional Exchange operations (`MoveToDeletedItems`, `MailItemsAccessed`, `Send`). Never rely on CloudAppEvents alone for mailbox forensics |
| **DataSecurityEvents** | **Advanced Hunting only** — requires Insider Risk Management opt-in. `SensitiveInfoTypeInfo` is `Collection(String)` NOT native dynamic — requires double `parse_json()`. Contains SIT **GUIDs** not names. Copilot events ("Risky prompt entered in Copilot", "Sensitive response received in Copilot") can dominate 90%+ of volume. `ObjectId` is the file identifier — `ObjectName`/`ObjectType` do NOT exist despite documentation. **Label columns:** `SensitivityLabelId` (string, can be comma-separated), `PreviousSensitivityLabelId` (string, label change events), `SharepointSiteSensitivityLabelId` (string), `RiskyAIUsageSensitivityLabelsInfo` (Collection(String), mostly `[null]`). Label data is sparse in SIT-dominant environments but significant in Purview-mature orgs | Always use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`. Double-parse: `mv-expand SIT = parse_json(tostring(SensitiveInfoTypeInfo)) \| extend SITJson = parse_json(tostring(SIT))`. Pre-filter with `where SensitiveInfoTypeInfo has "<GUID>"` before `mv-expand`. Use `split(SensitivityLabelId, ",")` for multi-GUID label values. Use `data-security-analysis` skill for SIT and label GUID-to-name resolution. If table returns 0 rows, check IRM opt-in status |
| **DeviceCustom\* (CDC Tables)** | Requires MDE Custom Data Collection (CDC) rules. These tables (`DeviceCustomFileEvents`, `DeviceCustomScriptEvents`, `DeviceCustomImageLoadEvents`, `DeviceCustomNetworkEvents`) do NOT exist in workspaces without CDC policies. They extend standard MDE telemetry beyond default thresholds. **Key per-table pitfalls:** `DeviceCustomScriptEvents` — script body is `ScriptContent`, NOT `AdditionalFields` (SemanticError); AMSI-only (Node.js/Go/Rust invisible). `DeviceCustomNetworkEvents` — coverage varies by CDC policy; some environments only collect Kerberos events, run discovery query first. `DeviceCustomFileEvents` — fills gaps when standard `DeviceFileEvents` returns 0 for known active directories. `DeviceCustomImageLoadEvents` — reveals native addons (`.node` modules, Python C extensions) | **CDC tables are optional** — if "Failed to resolve table", skip gracefully and note the telemetry gap. Query order: standard table first → if 0 results and activity is expected → try CDC equivalent → if CDC table doesn't exist → note as telemetry limitation |
| **DeviceInfo** | **Internet-facing detection pitfall:** `ExposureGraphNodes.rawData.IsInternetFacing`, `rawData.exposedToInternet`, and `rawData.isCustomerFacing` are all **unreliable** for determining actual internet exposure. `isCustomerFacing` is a business-function flag (NOT internet exposure). `IsInternetFacing`/`exposedToInternet` are not populated in many environments. LLMs default to querying these ExposureGraph properties and get null results. **`MachineTags` column renamed:** The old `MachineTags` column no longer exists — using it returns `Failed to resolve scalar expression`. It was split into three columns: `DeviceManualTags` (admin-set), `DeviceDynamicTags` (auto-assigned by rules), `RegistryDeviceTag` (set via registry). MS Learn may still reference `MachineTags` but the AH schema has only the new names. The Defender API `GetDefenderMachine` still returns `machineTags` (maps to `DeviceManualTags` in AH) | **Authoritative source:** Use `DeviceInfo.IsInternetFacing == true` (bool column). MDE maintains this via external scans + observed inbound connections; auto-expires after 48h. Extract details from `AdditionalFields`: `extractjson("$.InternetFacingReason", AdditionalFields)` (values: `PublicScan`, `InboundConnection`), `InternetFacingLocalPort`, `InternetFacingPublicScannedIp`. See `queries/network/internet_exposure_analysis.md` Query 1 and [MS Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/internet-facing-devices#use-advanced-hunting). For inbound scan detail: `DeviceNetworkEvents` with `ActionType == "InboundInternetScanInspected"`. **Tags:** Use `DeviceManualTags`, `DeviceDynamicTags`, `RegistryDeviceTag` — NEVER `MachineTags` |
| **DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities / DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory / DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment / SecurityRecommendation** | **Advanced Hunting only** — Defender TVM tables do NOT exist in Sentinel Data Lake. **DeviceName is stored as FQDN** (e.g., `myserver.contoso.com`), NOT short hostname. Using `DeviceName =~ 'hostname'` returns 0 results. **`Timestamp` column pitfall:** `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities` and `DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory` are **point-in-time snapshot tables with NO `Timestamp` column** — using `summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *)` or any `Timestamp` filter returns `Failed to resolve scalar expression`. `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment` DOES have `Timestamp`. LLMs assume all TVM tables share the same schema and consistently add `Timestamp` where it doesn't exist | Always use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`. **Per-device filter:** Use `DeviceName startswith '<hostname>'` (matches both short and FQDN). NEVER use `=~` with short names. **No deduplication needed** on `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities` / `DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory` — each row is already the latest state. For "last seen" or time context, join with `DeviceInfo` (which has `Timestamp`). For vulnerability investigations, use the `exposure-investigation` skill |
| **EntraIdSignInEvents** | **Case-sensitivity pitfall:** Capital `I` in `SignIn` — `EntraIdSigninEvents` (lowercase `i`) fails. `FetchAdvancedHuntingTablesDetailedSchema` does NOT index this table — use inline `getschema`. Covers **both interactive AND non-interactive** sign-ins — **default choice over** `SigninLogs` / `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` for AH queries (≤30d). SPN sign-ins use `EntraIdSpnSignInEvents`. **Column mapping vs Sentinel tables:** `ErrorCode` (int) vs `ResultType` (string), `AccountUpn` vs `UserPrincipalName`, `Application`/`ApplicationId` vs `AppDisplayName`/`AppId`, `Country`/`City` as direct strings (no `parse_json(LocationDetails)`), `RequestId` vs `OriginalRequestId`. **`LogonType` pitfall:** JSON array string (`["nonInteractiveUser"]`) — use `has` not `==`. `RiskLevelDuringSignIn`/`RiskState` are **int** (use `0`/`1`/`10`/`50`/`100`). `ConditionalAccessStatus` is **int** (`0`=applied, `1`=failed, `2`=not applied) | **AH queries (≤30d):** Default to `EntraIdSignInEvents`. **Data Lake / >30d:** Fall back to `SigninLogs` + `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` (union, 90+ day retention). Map column names when adapting between the two. [MS Learn reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-entraidsigninevents-table) |
| **ExposureGraphNodes / ExposureGraphEdges** | **Advanced Hunting only** — Exposure Management graph tables do NOT exist in Sentinel Data Lake | Always use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`. Uses `Timestamp`. See `exposure-investigation` skill for verified query patterns |
| **GraphAPIAuditEvents** | **Advanced Hunting only** — does NOT exist in Sentinel Data Lake. `ApplicationId` is **string** (Entra AppId GUID), but `ResponseStatusCode` is **string** — use `toint(ResponseStatusCode)` for numeric comparisons or `== "403"` for string matching. **Column name mismatches vs `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` (Data Lake):** AH uses `ApplicationId` / `AccountObjectId` / `ServicePrincipalId`; Data Lake uses `AppId` / `UserId` / `ServicePrincipalId`. `Scopes`, `Roles`, `SessionId`, `UniqueTokenId`, `DurationMs` are **Data Lake only**. `TargetWorkload`, `EntityType` are **AH only**. **`OAuthAppInfo` join:** Use `OAuthAppInfo.OAuthAppId` (NOT `ApplicationId` — column doesn't exist on `OAuthAppInfo`) | Always use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`. For >30d investigations or token/session correlation, use `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` in Data Lake. Map column names when switching platforms. See `queries/cloud/graph_api_security_monitoring.md` for verified query patterns |
| **IdentityAccountInfo** | **Advanced Hunting only** — does NOT exist in Sentinel Data Lake. Table is in **Preview** — schema may change and many fields are not yet populated (`EnrolledMfas`, `TenantMembershipType`, `AuthenticationMethod`, `CriticalityLevel`, `DefenderRiskLevel`). Multiple snapshot records per account; `AssignedRoles` and `GroupMembership` are dynamic arrays. `SourceProviderRiskLevel` values vary by provider (AAD=High/Medium/Low, Okta=HIGH/MEDIUM, SailPoint=HIGH). `AccountStatus` vocabularies differ across providers (AAD: Enabled/Disabled/Deleted; SailPoint: ACTIVE/NONE/INACTIVE; Okta: STAGED/ACTIVE/DEPROVISIONED; CyberArk: ACTIVE/INVITED/SUSPENDED). **IdentityInfo UAC join pitfall:** `array_index_of(null_dynamic, "value")` returns `null` (not `-1`). Since `null != -1` is `true` in KQL, querying `array_index_of(UserAccountControl, "PasswordNeverExpires") != -1` without first filtering `isnotnull(UserAccountControl)` incorrectly returns true for ALL null-UAC accounts (~99% of identities), massively inflating PwdNeverExpires counts | Always use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`. Deduplicate with `summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AccountId` (per-account) or `by IdentityId` (cross-provider). Parse roles/groups: `mv-expand Role = parse_json(AssignedRoles)`. `IdentityId` links accounts across providers — one identity can have accounts from multiple sources. For enrichment, join with `IdentityInfo` on `IdentityId` (not `AccountUpn` — avoids 1:many inflation). **When using UserAccountControl from IdentityInfo:** MUST add `where isnotnull(UserAccountControl)` BEFORE computing boolean flags with `array_index_of`. Use `identity-posture` skill for comprehensive identity posture reports |
| **OfficeActivity** | Mailbox forwarding/redirect rules live here, **NOT in AuditLogs** | Filter by `OfficeWorkload == "Exchange"` and `Operation in~ ("New-InboxRule", "Set-InboxRule", "Set-Mailbox", "UpdateInboxRules")`. Check `Parameters` for `ForwardTo`, `RedirectTo`, `ForwardingSmtpAddress`. This table is the **primary source** for detecting email exfiltration via forwarding rules (MITRE T1114.003 / T1020). |
| **OfficeActivity** | `Parameters` and `OperationProperties` are **string fields** containing JSON | Use `contains` or `has` for keyword matching, then `parse_json(Parameters)` to extract specific values. Do NOT query AuditLogs for mailbox rule changes — they only appear in OfficeActivity (Exchange workload). |
| **OAuthAppInfo** | **Advanced Hunting only**. Key column is **`OAuthAppId`** (string, Entra AppId GUID), NOT `ApplicationId` — column doesn't exist on this table. Multiple snapshot rows per app; `Permissions` is dynamic. Other key columns: `AppName`, `PrivilegeLevel`, `AppOrigin` (Internal/External), `AppStatus`, `IsAdminConsented`, `VerifiedPublisher`. When cross-referencing with `GraphAPIAuditEvents`, join on `OAuthAppInfo.OAuthAppId == GraphAPIAuditEvents.ApplicationId` | Always use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`. Deduplicate with `summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by OAuthAppId`. For app permission audits, use `app-registration-posture` skill |
| **SecurityAlert** | `Status` field is **immutable** — always "New" regardless of actual state | MUST join with `SecurityIncident` to get real Status/Classification (see [Appendix pattern](#securityalertstatus-is-immutable---always-join-securityincident)) |
| **SecurityAlert** | `ProviderName` is an internal identifier (e.g., `MDATP`, `ASI Scheduled Alerts`, `MCAS`) and rolls up to generic names like `Microsoft XDR` at the incident level | Use **`ProductName`** for product grouping (e.g., `Azure Sentinel`, `Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection`, `Microsoft Data Loss Prevention`). Also available: `ProductComponentName` (e.g., `Scheduled Alerts`, `NRT Alerts`). Translate raw values to current branding in reports. |
| **SecurityIncident** | `AlertIds` contains **SystemAlertId GUIDs**, NOT usernames, IPs, or entity names | NEVER filter `AlertIds` by entity name. Instead: query `SecurityAlert` first filtering by `Entities has '<entity>'`, then join to `SecurityIncident` on AlertId |
| **SecurityIncident** | **Phantom incidents with empty `AlertIds`:** Many Defender XDR-synced incidents have `AlertIds = []` — these never appear in the portal or Graph API and inflate closed incident counts. `TimeGenerated > ago(7d)` also captures old incidents with recent status updates, further inflating counts | **For accurate closed counts:** (1) Use `CreatedTime` (not `TimeGenerated`) for time-windowed queries, (2) Add `\| where array_length(AlertIds) > 0` to exclude phantom incidents |
| **SecurityIncident / SecurityAlert** | `IncidentNumber` and `SystemAlertId` are **Sentinel-local IDs** — Triage MCP uses **Defender XDR IDs** | Use `ProviderIncidentId` for Triage MCP lookups. See [Sentinel ↔ Defender XDR ID Mapping](#-sentinel--defender-xdr-id-mapping--global-rule) for full mapping |
| **SentinelHealth** | `SentinelResourceType` values use **title-case with a space**: `"Analytics Rule"`, NOT `"Analytic rule"`. LLMs consistently generate the wrong casing/spelling, returning 0 results despite 30k+ rows in the table | Always use `SentinelResourceType == "Analytics Rule"` (capital A, capital R, "Analytics" with an 's'). Other valid values: `"Data connector"`, `"Automation rule"`. If query returns 0 rows, check this filter first |
| **SigninLogs** / **AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs** | `DeviceDetail`, `LocationDetails`, `ConditionalAccessPolicies`, `Status` may be **dynamic OR string** depending on workspace (Data Lake workspaces store them as strings). `AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs` stores these as **string always** | Always use `tostring(parse_json(DeviceDetail).operatingSystem)` — works for both types. Direct dot-notation `DeviceDetail.operatingSystem` fails with SemanticError when column is string type. Same applies to `Status` (use `parse_json(Status).errorCode`), `ConditionalAccessPolicies` — use `parse_json()` before dot-access or `mv-expand` |
| **SigninLogs** | `Location` is a **string** column, NOT dynamic. Dot-notation like `Location.countryOrRegion` will fail with SemanticError | Use `parse_json(LocationDetails).countryOrRegion` for geographic sub-properties. `Location` works with `dcount()`, `has`, `isnotempty()` but NOT dot-property access |
| **Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL** | Custom `_CL` table names are **case-sensitive**. Table uses lowercase 'l' in "logs" — `Signinlogs` NOT `SigninLogs`. LLMs auto-correct this to match `SigninLogs` | Always copy exact table name `Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL`. If `SemanticError: Failed to resolve table`, verify casing first. If still fails, table may not exist in the workspace — skip gracefully |
| **UnifiedAgentObservability** | **Sentinel Data Lake system table** (Agent 365 / A365 Observability connector). Lake-only — NOT in Advanced Hunting or Triage MCP. Fails with `SemanticError: Failed to resolve table` under a workspace GUID; `search_tables` doesn't index it. Uses `TimeGenerated`. **Quick gotchas:** `ToolName` is a **top-level** column (NOT inside `AdditionalFields` — `AF.ToolName` silently returns null); `InvokeAgent` rows have `SrcAgentId = "00000000-..."` (zero-GUID); `ActorUsername = "N/A"` on `ExecuteToolBySDK` rows. **See [queries/cloud/agent365_observability.md](../queries/cloud/agent365_observability.md) Query 9** for the full schema reference, cross-source join patterns with `CloudAppEvents` `CopilotInteraction` (incl. `Messages[].JailbreakDetected` PascalCase pitfall), and validated jailbreak → tool-call chain queries. | **Pass `workspaceId: "default"`** for single-table queries. **For cross-scope joins with workspace tables**: pass `workspaceId: <workspace-guid>` and reference as `workspace("default").UnifiedAgentObservability`. `parse_json()` dynamic columns before dot-access or `mv-expand`. |
| **Anomalies** | Sentinel UEBA built-in anomaly rule results (distinct from `BehaviorInfo`/`BehaviorAnalytics`). `Tactics` and `Techniques` are **JSON strings**, not arrays — must `parse_json()` before `make_set()`. `AnomalyReasons` is a dynamic array of objects with `IsAnomalous` (bool) and `Name` fields — filter `tobool(reason.IsAnomalous) == true` to extract only the anomalous flags. `DeviceInsights.ThreatIntelIndicatorType` frequently shows `BruteForce` on corporate/Azure egress IPs (TITAN reputation false positive). `UserPrincipalName` is populated — use `=~` for user-scoped queries (the entity-matching `mv-apply` on `Entities` is NOT required). Score 0.0–1.0: ≥0.7 High, 0.3–0.7 Medium, <0.3 Low. Available in **both** Data Lake and Advanced Hunting | Use `UserPrincipalName =~` for user filtering. Always `parse_json(Tactics)` and `parse_json(Techniques)` before aggregation. Filter `AnomalyReasons` with `tobool(reason.IsAnomalous) == true`. Do NOT confuse with `BehaviorInfo` (MCAS, AH-only) or `BehaviorAnalytics` (raw UEBA events, Data Lake-only) — three separate tables |

> **💡 CDC Telemetry Escalation Pattern:** When standard MDE tables return 0 results for activity you have evidence exists, check whether `DeviceCustom*` tables are available. Not all environments have CDC enabled — if the tables don't resolve, document the telemetry gap rather than assuming absence of activity.

### Step 3b: Common KQL Anti-Patterns (All Tables)

These universal KQL mistakes are frequent LLM errors regardless of which table is queried:

| Anti-Pattern | Error | Fix |
|-------------|-------|-----|
| `mv-expand` on string column containing JSON | `expanded expression expected to have dynamic type` | `mv-expand parsed = parse_json(StringColumn)` — parse_json() BEFORE mv-expand |
| `dcount()` on dynamic column | `argument #1 cannot be dynamic` | `dcount(tostring(DynamicColumn))` — cast to scalar |
| `bin()` missing argument | `bin(): function expects 2 argument(s)` | Always provide both: `bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)` |
| `iff()` with mismatched branch types | `@then data type (real) must match @else (long)` | Cast both branches: `iff(cond, todouble(x), todouble(y))` |
| Joining on dynamic column | `join key 'X' is of a 'dynamic' type` | Cast before join: `\| extend AlertId = tostring(AlertId) \| join ...` |
| Duplicate column in `union` | `column named 'X' already exists` | Use `project-away` or `project-rename` before union |
| `prev()`/`next()` on unserialized rowset | `Function 'prev' cannot be invoked in current context` | Add `\| serialize` before `prev()`, `next()`, `row_cumsum()`, `row_number()` |

### Step 4: Validate Before Execution

- For complex queries: use `validate_kql_query` to check syntax
- Ensure datetime filter is the FIRST filter in the query
- Use `take` or `summarize` to limit results

### Step 5: Sanity-Check Zero Results

**If a query returns 0 results for a commonly-populated table, STOP and verify:**

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Is the query logic correct? | Review join conditions, filter values, and field types |
| Am I filtering on GUIDs where I used a name (or vice versa)? | Check schema for field content type |
| Is the date range appropriate? | Ensure the time filter covers the expected data window |
| Does the table exist in this data source? | Try the other KQL execution tool if applicable |

⛔ **DO NOT report "no results found" until you have verified the query itself is correct.** A zero-result query may indicate a bad query, not absence of data.

### Step 6: Execute Before Sharing

**Any KQL query block presented to the user — inline or in a `🎬 Take Action` portal handoff — MUST be valid, tested, and confirmed to return results before sharing. The only exception is when 0 results is the intended outcome AND the reasoning is communicated to the user.** If a query returns 0 unexpectedly, apply Step 5 sanity-check, fix it, and re-run. Do not paste untested KQL into chat.

### 🔴 PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Calling `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` or `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` before doing a Priority 1 (manifest) or Priority 2 (grep) discovery check for the keyword/topic in this turn | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Treating a "hunt for X" / "search for X" / "look for X" / "find Y" / "do we have Z" request as exempt from Step 1 | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Writing KQL from scratch without completing Steps 1-2 | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Filtering `SecurityIncident.AlertIds` by entity names | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Reading `SecurityAlert.Status` as current investigation status | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Reporting 0 results without sanity-checking the query logic | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Sharing an investigative KQL query with the user without executing it first | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Using `Timestamp` on Sentinel/LA tables in Data Lake queries | ❌ **PROHIBITED** — use `TimeGenerated` |
| Executing `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` when user-requested lookback > 30 days | ❌ **PROHIBITED** — AH silently truncates to 30d; use `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` instead |

## 🔴 EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS - GLOBAL RULE

**This rule applies to ALL skills, ALL queries, and ALL investigation outputs.**

### Core Principle
Base ALL findings strictly on data returned by MCP tools. Never invent, assume, or extrapolate data that was not explicitly retrieved.

### Required Behaviors

| Scenario | Required Action |
|----------|----------------|
| Query returns 0 results | State explicitly: "✅ No [anomaly/alert/event type] found in [time range]" |
| Field is null/missing in response | Report as "Unknown" or "Not available" - never fabricate values |
| Partial data available | State what WAS found and what COULD NOT be verified |
| User asks about data not queried | Query first, then answer - never guess based on "typical patterns" |

### 🔴 PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Inventing IP addresses, usernames, or entity names | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Assuming counts or statistics not in query results | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Describing "typical behavior" when no baseline was queried | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Omitting sections silently when no data exists | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Using phrases like "likely", "probably", "typically" without evidence | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |

### ✅ REQUIRED Output Patterns

**When data IS found:**
```
📊 Found 47 failed sign-ins from IP 203.0.113.42 between 2026-01-15 and 2026-01-22.
Evidence: SigninLogs query returned 47 records with ResultType=50126.
```

**When NO data is found:**
```
✅ No failed sign-ins detected for user@domain.com in the last 7 days.
Query: SigninLogs | where UserPrincipalName =~ 'user@domain.com' | where ResultType != 0
Result: 0 records
```

**When data is PARTIAL:**
```
⚠️ Sign-in data available, but DeviceEvents table not accessible in this workspace.
Verified: 12 successful authentications from 3 IPs
Unable to verify: Endpoint process activity (table not found)
```

### Risk Assessment Grounding

When assigning risk levels, cite the specific evidence:

| Risk Level | Evidence Required |
|------------|-------------------|
| **High** | Must cite ≥2 concrete findings (e.g., "AbuseIPDB score 95 + 47 failed logins in 1 hour") |
| **Medium** | Must cite ≥1 concrete finding with context (e.g., "New IP not in 90-day baseline") |
| **Low** | Must explain why low despite investigation (e.g., "IP is known corporate VPN egress") |
| **Informational** | Must still cite what was checked: "No alerts, no anomalies, no risky sign-ins found" |

### Emoji Formatting for Investigation Output

Use color-coded emojis consistently throughout investigation reports to make risks, mitigating factors, and status immediately scannable:

| Category | Emoji | When to Use |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **High risk / critical finding** | 🔴 | High-severity alerts, confirmed compromise, high abuse scores, active threats |
| **Medium risk / warning** | 🟠 | Medium-severity detections, unresolved risk states, suspicious but unconfirmed activity |
| **Low risk / minor concern** | 🟡 | Low-severity detections, informational anomalies, items needing review but not urgent |
| **Mitigating factor / positive** | 🟢 | MFA enforced, phishing-resistant auth, clean threat intel, risk remediated/dismissed |
| **Informational / neutral** | 🔵 | Contextual notes, baseline data, configuration details, reference information |
| **Absence confirmed / clean** | ✅ | No alerts found, no anomalies, clean query results, verified safe |
| **Needs attention / action item** | ⚠️ | Unresolved risks, report-only policies, recommendations requiring human decision |
| **Data not available** | ❓ | Table not accessible, partial data, unable to verify |

**Example usage in summary tables:**
```markdown
| Factor | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| 🟢 **Auth Method** | Phishing-resistant passkey (device-bound) — strong credential |
| 🟠 **IP Reputation** | VPN exit node with 14 abuse reports (low confidence 5%) |
| 🔴 **Unresolved Risk** | `unfamiliarFeatures` detection still atRisk — needs admin action |
| ⚠️ **CA Policy Gap** | "Require MFA for risky sign-ins" is report-only, not enforcing |
| ✅ **MFA Enforcement** | MFA required and passed on 16/18 sign-ins |
```

Apply these emojis in:
- Summary assessment tables (prefix the factor name)
- Section headers when results indicate clear risk or clean status
- Inline findings where risk/mitigation context helps readability
- Recommendation items (prefix with ⚠️ for action items, 🟢 for confirmations)

### Explicit Absence Confirmation

After every investigation section, confirm what was checked even if nothing was found:

```markdown
## Security Alerts
✅ No security alerts involving user@domain.com in the last 30 days.
- Checked: SecurityAlert table (0 matches)
- Checked: SecurityIncident for associated entities (0 matches)
```

### Technical Context Enrichment

When explaining technical concepts, use **Microsoft Learn MCP** to ground responses in official documentation:

| When to Use | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Explaining error codes | Search for "SigninLogs ResultType 50126" to get official meaning |
| Describing attack techniques | Search for "AiTM phishing" or "token theft" for official remediation guidance |
| Clarifying Azure/M365 features | Search for "Conditional Access device compliance" for accurate configuration details |
| Interpreting log fields | Search for table schema documentation when field meaning is unclear |

**Workflow:**
1. `microsoft_docs_search` → Find relevant articles
2. `microsoft_docs_fetch` → Get complete details when needed
3. **Cite the source** in your response (include URL when providing technical guidance)

---

## 🔴 REMEDIATION OUTPUT POLICY - GLOBAL RULE

**Applies to ALL skills and investigation outputs.**

Never generate executable commands that change tenant, mailbox, user, device, or resource state. Route the admin through audited UI paths instead.

### ✅ Allowed
- Portal deep links with navigation steps (Defender XDR, Entra, EAC, Purview, Azure Portal)
- Natural-language instructions describing what the admin should do
- Read-only verification KQL (labeled as such) and read-only Graph `GET` calls

### ❌ Prohibited
- State-changing PowerShell (`Remove-*`, `Set-*`, `New-*`, `Disable-*`, `Revoke-*`)
- `az` CLI write operations (`create`, `set`, `update`, `delete`)
- Graph API write calls (`Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method PATCH/POST/PUT/DELETE`, `curl -X POST`, etc.)
- Any snippet the admin could paste to mutate state — even labeled "for reference" or "optional"

### Exceptions
- **Skill-defined actions** — if a skill's SKILL.md explicitly specifies state-changing commands as part of its workflow (e.g., `detection-authoring`), those are allowed within that skill's scope.
- **User explicitly requests a command** — confirm the ask, then generate with `-WhatIf` / dry-run by default and flag the destructive operation.

2. **Getting started / exploratory requests:** If the user asks "what can you do?", "where do I start?", "help me investigate", "how do I use this", "show me what you can do", "what's going on?", or any open-ended orientation question — **recommend and offer to run the `threat-pulse` skill** as the starting point. Briefly explain it runs a 15-minute broad scan across 7 security domains and produces a prioritized dashboard with drill-down recommendations to specialized skills. Ask if they'd like to run it.
3. **If match found:** Read the skill file:
   - Standard skills: `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
   - Subfolder skills (e.g., scope-drift-detection): `.github/skills/<parent-skill>/<sub-skill>/SKILL.md`
4. **Follow skill-specific workflow** (inherits global rules from this file)
5. **Future skills:** Check `.github/skills/` folder with `list_dir` to discover new workflows

**Skill files location:** `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` or `.github/skills/<parent-skill>/<sub-skill>/SKILL.md`

## Integration with MCP Servers

The investigation system integrates with these MCP servers (which Copilot has access to):

### Microsoft Sentinel Data Lake MCP
Execute KQL queries and explore table schemas directly against your Sentinel workspace:
- **mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake**: Execute read-only KQL queries on Sentinel data lake tables. Best practices: filter on datetime first, use `take` or `summarize` operators to limit results, prefer narrowly scoped queries with explicit filters
- **mcp_sentinel-data_search_tables**: Discover table schemas using natural language queries. Returns table definitions to support query authoring
- **mcp_sentinel-data_list_sentinel_workspaces**: List all available Sentinel workspace name/ID pairs
- **🔴 `workspaceId` scope selection:**
  - **Single-table queries on lake-only system tables** (`UnifiedAgentObservability` from the Agent 365 / A365 Observability connector, etc.) — pass `workspaceId: "default"`. Under a workspace GUID these return `SemanticError: Failed to resolve table` and `search_tables` does not index them. Also not available via Advanced Hunting or Triage MCP. If a documented lake table fails to resolve, retry once with `"default"` before reporting it missing.
  - **Cross-scope joins** (system table ↔ workspace table like `CloudAppEvents`, `IdentityInfo`, `_KQL_CL`) — pass `workspaceId: <workspace-guid>` and reach into the lake via `workspace("default").<Table>`. The reverse (`workspaceId: "default"` + `workspace("<guid>").<Table>`) returns `WorkspaceNotAvailable`. The MCP param accepts one ID only — comma/semicolon/space-separated lists return `Kusto database name not found`.
- **Documentation**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/datalake/

### Microsoft Sentinel Triage MCP
Incident investigation and threat hunting tools for Defender XDR and Sentinel:
- **Incident Management**: List/get incidents (`ListIncidents`, `GetIncidentById`), list/get alerts (`ListAlerts`, `GetAlertByID`)
  - **⚠️ `ListAlerts` limitation:** This tool has NO `incidentId` parameter. It only supports `createdAfter`, `createdBefore`, `severity`, `status`, `skip`, `top`. Calling it returns **all tenant alerts** up to the page size — any unsupported parameter is silently ignored. **To get alerts for a specific incident**, use `GetIncidentById` with `includeAlertsData=true`, or query `AlertInfo`/`AlertEvidence` via `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` with entity-based filtering.
- **Advanced Hunting**: Run KQL queries across Defender XDR tables and connected Log Analytics workspace tables (`RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`), fetch table schemas (`FetchAdvancedHuntingTablesOverview`, `FetchAdvancedHuntingTablesDetailedSchema`)
  - **⚠️ Parameter name:** Use `kqlQuery`, NOT `query` (see Troubleshooting Guide).
- **Entity Investigation**: File info/stats/alerts (`GetDefenderFileInfo`, `GetDefenderFileStatistics`, `GetDefenderFileAlerts`), device details (`GetDefenderMachine`, `GetDefenderMachineAlerts`, `GetDefenderMachineLoggedOnUsers`), IP analysis (`GetDefenderIpAlerts`, `GetDefenderIpStatistics`), user activity (`ListUserRelatedAlerts`, `ListUserRelatedMachines`)
- **Vulnerability Management**: List affected devices (`ListDefenderMachinesByVulnerability`), software vulnerabilities (`ListDefenderVulnerabilitiesBySoftware`)
- **Remediation**: List/get remediation tasks (`ListDefenderRemediationActivities`, `GetDefenderRemediationActivity`)
- **When to Use**: Incident triage, threat hunting over your own Defender/Sentinel data, correlating alerts/entities during investigations
- **Documentation**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/datalake/sentinel-mcp-triage-tool

### 🔗 Sentinel ↔ Defender XDR ID Mapping — GLOBAL RULE

**The Sentinel Triage MCP (`GetIncidentById`, `GetAlertById`, `ListAlerts`) uses Defender XDR IDs, NOT Sentinel table IDs.** Passing Sentinel IDs to these tools returns "not found" errors.

| Sentinel Table Field | What It Is | Triage MCP Equivalent | How to Map |
|---------------------|------------|----------------------|------------|
| `SecurityIncident.IncidentNumber` | Sentinel-assigned sequential number | ❌ **Not accepted** by `GetIncidentById` | Use `SecurityIncident.ProviderIncidentId` instead — this is the Defender XDR incident ID |
| `SecurityIncident.ProviderIncidentId` | Defender XDR incident ID | ✅ **Pass this** to `GetIncidentById` | Direct — no mapping needed |
| `SecurityAlert.SystemAlertId` | Sentinel-assigned alert GUID | ❌ **Not accepted** by `GetAlertById` | Extract `IncidentId` from `SecurityAlert.ExtendedProperties` for the Defender XDR ID |

**When you discover incidents/alerts via Sentinel KQL (SecurityIncident, SecurityAlert tables) and need to drill down via Triage MCP:**

1. **For incidents:** Always `project ProviderIncidentId` in your Sentinel query and pass **that** value to `GetIncidentById`
2. **For alerts:** Extract the Defender ID from `ExtendedProperties`: `tostring(parse_json(ExtendedProperties).IncidentId)` — or query the incident via `ProviderIncidentId` first
3. **Never pass** `IncidentNumber` or `SystemAlertId` to Triage MCP tools

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Passing `SecurityIncident.IncidentNumber` to `GetIncidentById` | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Passing `SecurityAlert.SystemAlertId` to `GetAlertById` | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Using `ProviderIncidentId` from SecurityIncident for Triage MCP calls | ✅ **REQUIRED** |
| Extracting Defender ID from `ExtendedProperties.IncidentId` for alert drill-down | ✅ **REQUIRED** |

### 📋 SecurityIncident Query & Output Standards — GLOBAL RULE

**These rules apply to ALL SecurityIncident queries, not just Triage MCP interactions.**

Every SecurityIncident query MUST include `ProviderIncidentId` in the output and every incident presented to the user MUST include a clickable Defender XDR portal URL: `https://security.microsoft.com/incidents/{ProviderIncidentId}?tid=<tenant_id>` (read `tenant_id` from `config.json`; omit `?tid=` if not configured).

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Querying SecurityIncident without projecting `ProviderIncidentId` | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Presenting incidents to user without Defender XDR portal URL | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Using `IncidentNumber` as the primary identifier in output | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Including clickable `https://security.microsoft.com/incidents/{ProviderIncidentId}?tid=<tenant_id>` link | ✅ **REQUIRED** |

### 🔗 Tenant ID in Portal URLs — GLOBAL RULE

**ALL `security.microsoft.com` URLs** generated in output MUST include the `tid` query parameter for reliable cross-tenant deep linking. Read `tenant_id` from `config.json`.

| URL has existing query params? | Append |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| No query string | `?tid=<tenant_id>` |
| Has `?` already | `&tid=<tenant_id>` |

**If `tenant_id` is not configured** (missing, empty, or placeholder `YOUR_*`): omit `tid` entirely.

This applies to: incident links, entity links (user, domain, IP, device, file hash), and AH portal links (`https://security.microsoft.com/v2/advanced-hunting?tid=<tenant_id>` — plain link, no encoded query). KQL `strcat()` patterns must substitute the `tenant_id` value at query time.

### 🔴 URL Hallucination — GLOBAL RULE

Only output a portal URL if it is documented in the active skill, a `queries/` file, or this file — or built from such a template by substituting query-result IDs. Otherwise use a plain-text breadcrumb (e.g., *Defender XDR → Settings → Indicators*). Never construct portal URLs from memory.

### 🔧 Tool Selection Rule: Data Lake vs Advanced Hunting

> See [Step 0 of the KQL pre-flight checklist](#step-0-pick-the-right-tool-for-the-lookback-window) for the lookback-based decision and timestamp adaptation. This section covers the remaining differences.

**Key facts:**
- The LA workspace is connected to the unified Defender portal. Advanced Hunting can query **all** tables in the workspace — XDR-native tables (Device*, Email*, etc.), Sentinel-native tables (SigninLogs, AuditLogs, LAQueryLogs, etc.), and custom tables (`*_CL`). It is NOT limited to Defender XDR data only.
- **Custom Detection eligibility:** `_CL` tables are **fully supported** for Custom Detection rules, including NRT frequency. Examples: `ABAPAuditLog_CL`, `Okta_CL`, `ProofPointTAPClicksPermitted_CL`. See the detection-authoring skill for the complete NRT-supported table list.
- **ASIM parser functions** (`_Im_NetworkSession`, `_Im_WebSession`, `_Im_Dns`, `_Im_ProcessEvent`, etc.) and other workspace-level functions are **fully supported in Advanced Hunting** — they resolve against the connected LA workspace. `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` **cannot resolve** workspace-level functions and returns `Unknown function` errors for `_Im_*` calls. Use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` for ASIM parser queries.

| Factor | `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` (Advanced Hunting) | `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` (Sentinel Data Lake) |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cost** | Free for Analytics-tier tables (Defender license). Auxiliary/Basic-tier tables still incur query costs even when queried via AH. | Billed per query (Log Analytics costs) |
| **Retention** | 30 days (Graph API cap — silently truncates). | 90+ days (workspace-configured) |
| **Safety filter** | MCP-level filter may block queries with offensive-security keywords | No additional filter beyond KQL validation |
| **Negation syntax** | `!has_any` / `!in~` may fail in `let` blocks — use `not()` wrappers | Standard KQL negation operators work reliably |
| **Workspace functions** | Supports ASIM parsers and workspace-level functions | Cannot resolve workspace-level functions |

**Fallback triggers (switch AH → Data Lake):**
- Lookback > 30 days (see Step 0)
- Query blocked by AH safety filter
- AH returns "table not found" (legacy tables, some custom tables)

#### Skill File Override Rule

**When executing a skill workflow** (from `.github/skills/`), the skill's tool specifications take precedence over the ad-hoc rule. Skills may choose a specific tool deliberately for retention requirements, safety-filter avoidance, or tested compatibility.

### KQL Search MCP
GitHub-powered KQL query discovery and schema intelligence (331+ tables from Defender XDR, Sentinel, Azure Monitor):
- **GitHub Query Discovery**: Search GitHub for KQL examples (`search_github_examples_fallback` ✅), find repos (`search_kql_repositories` ✅), extract from files (`get_kql_from_file` ✅). **Note:** `search_favorite_repos` has a known bug (v1.0.5) - use `search_github_examples_fallback` instead.
- **Schema Intelligence**: Get table schemas (`get_table_schema`), search tables by description (`search_tables`), find columns (`find_column`), list categories (`list_table_categories`)
- **Query Generation & Validation**: Generate validated KQL queries from natural language (`generate_kql_query`), validate existing queries (`validate_kql_query`), get Microsoft Learn docs (`get_query_documentation`)
- **ASIM Schema Support**: Search/validate/generate queries for 11 ASIM schemas (`search_asim_schemas`, `get_asim_schema_info`, `validate_asim_parser`, `generate_asim_query_template`)
- **When to Use**: Writing new KQL queries, finding query examples from community repos (Azure-Sentinel, Microsoft-365-Defender-Hunting-Queries), validating query syntax before execution, understanding table schemas
- **Documentation**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/kql-search-mcp

### Microsoft Learn MCP
Official Microsoft/Azure documentation search and code samples:
- **microsoft_docs_search**: Semantic search across Microsoft Learn documentation (returns up to 10 high-quality content chunks with title, URL, excerpt)
- **microsoft_docs_fetch**: Fetch complete Microsoft Learn pages in markdown format (use after search when you need full tutorials, troubleshooting guides, or complete documentation)
- **microsoft_code_sample_search**: Search official Microsoft/Azure code samples (up to 20 relevant code snippets with optional `language` filter: csharp, javascript, typescript, python, powershell, azurecli, sql, java, kusto, etc.)
- **When to Use**: Grounding answers in official Microsoft knowledge, finding latest Azure/Microsoft 365/Security documentation, getting official code examples for Microsoft technologies, verifying API usage patterns
- **Workflow**: Use `microsoft_docs_search` first for breadth → `microsoft_code_sample_search` for practical examples → `microsoft_docs_fetch` for depth when needed
- **Documentation**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/support/mcp-get-started

### Microsoft Graph MCP
Azure AD and Microsoft 365 API integration:
- **mcp_microsoft_mcp_microsoft_graph_suggest_queries**: Find Graph API endpoints using natural language intent descriptions
- **mcp_microsoft_mcp_microsoft_graph_get**: Execute Graph API calls (MUST call suggest_queries first to get correct endpoints)
- **mcp_microsoft_mcp_microsoft_graph_list_properties**: Explore entity schemas when RAG examples are insufficient
- **Critical Workflow**: ALWAYS call `suggest_queries` before `get` - never construct URLs from memory. Resolve template variables before making final API calls
- **Documentation**: Built-in Graph MCP integration

### Sentinel Heatmap MCP (Custom Visualization)
Interactive heatmap visualization for Sentinel security data, rendered inline in VS Code chat:
- **mcp_sentinel-heat_show-signin-heatmap**: Display aggregated data as an interactive heatmap with optional threat intel drill-down
- **Location**: `mcp-apps/sentinel-heatmap-server/` (local TypeScript/React MCP App)
- **Data format**: Array of `{row, column, value}` objects. Optional: `title`, `rowLabel`, `colLabel`, `valueLabel`, `colorScale` (`green-red`/`blue-red`/`blue-yellow`), `enrichment` (IP threat intel for drill-down panels)
- **When to Use**: Visualizing attack patterns by IP and time, sign-in activity by app/hour, failed auth by location/day
- **See**: `heatmap-visualization` skill for full usage guidance, KQL query patterns, and enrichment schema

### Azure MCP Server
Direct Azure Resource Manager and Azure Monitor integration for quick ad-hoc queries:
- **`mcp_azure-mcp-ser_monitor` → `monitor_workspace_log_query`**: Execute KQL queries directly against Log Analytics workspace via Azure Monitor API. Same data as Sentinel Data Lake, but through the ARM path — useful for fast ad-hoc queries within the 90-day retention window.
- **`mcp_azure-mcp-ser_monitor` → `monitor_activitylog_list`**: Get Azure Activity Logs for specific resources (deployments, modifications, access patterns)
- **`mcp_azure-mcp-ser_group_list`**: List resource groups in a subscription
- **`mcp_azure-mcp-ser_subscription_list`**: List subscriptions

**Required parameters:** Read `tenant`, `subscription`, `resource-group`, and `workspace` from `config.json` (`azure_mcp` section). See [Environment Configuration](#-environment-configuration) for field mapping.

**When to use Azure MCP Server `workspace_log_query` vs Sentinel Data Lake `query_lake`:**

| Factor | Azure MCP `workspace_log_query` | Sentinel Data Lake `query_lake` |
|--------|---|---|
| **Speed** | Faster for ad-hoc (direct ARM call) | 5-15 min ingestion lag for very recent data |
| **Auth** | DefaultAzureCredential (VS Code cached) | Sentinel Platform Services OAuth |
| **Params** | Needs `resource-group` + `workspace` name + `table` | Needs `workspaceId` (GUID) |
| **Retention** | 90 days | 90 days (same workspace) |
| **Best for** | Quick lookups, AzureActivity, ad-hoc exploration | Skill-based investigation workflows |

> **Azure MCP telemetry detection:** See `mcp-usage-monitoring` skill (Queries 25-27) for Azure MCP Server fingerprinting and usage analysis.

- **Documentation**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/overview

### Sentinel Exposure Graph Tools (bundled in Sentinel Data Lake MCP)
Attack surface analysis tools for the Microsoft Security Exposure Management graph. **More effective than raw KQL** for per-asset attack path scenarios — use these first, fall back to KQL for fleet-wide sweeps.

> **Bundled in the Sentinel Data Lake MCP** (`data-exploration` server) alongside `query_lake`. Tool names have **no `graph_` prefix** (e.g., `find_blastradius`). The standalone `sentinel-graph-mcp` (`/mcp/graph`) server is redundant.

- **`find_blastradius`**: All downstream targets reachable from a source asset. Params: `sourceName`
- **`find_exposure_perimeter`**: Inbound perimeter — externally-reachable nodes with walkable paths TO a target. Params: `targetName`
  - **Known limitation:** May return empty for assets that ARE network-reachable but lack formal ExposureGraph perimeter classification. Fall back to KQL edge analysis with `EdgeLabel == "routes traffic to"` when empty.
- **`find_walkable_paths`**: Full path between source and target (up to 4 hops) with RBAC role detail, `isOverProvisioned` and `isIdentityInactive` flags. Params: `sourceName`, `targetName`
- **`find_connected_nodes`**: Find pairs of graph nodes connected by walkable edges, filtered by source/target node labels and properties. Params: `sourceNodeLabel`, `targetNodeLabel` (plus optional `sourceNodeProperties`, `targetNodeProperties`, `resultsCountLimit`)
- **`find_nodes`**: Locate graph nodes matching label/property criteria.
- **`get_graph_context`**: Full graph schema (node/edge types). Call before `find_connected_nodes` to validate labels/properties.
- **`analyze_user_entity` / `analyze_url_entity` / `analyze_application_entity`**: Entity-level analysis for users, URLs, and app registrations.

> **⚠️ Large results:** `find_blastradius` on a privileged identity can return 100+ walkable paths (100KB+). The MCP writes oversized results to a session file — parse the JSON with PowerShell rather than reading it inline.

**Workflow:** blast radius → exposure perimeter → walkable paths for specific targets → connected nodes by type → KQL for fleet-wide analysis

- **When to Use**: Investigating compromised assets, mapping blast radius after incidents, validating attack paths, assessing critical asset exposure, identifying over-provisioned identities along permission chains
- **When to Use KQL Instead**: Fleet-wide sweeps, cookie chain analysis across all devices, choke point detection, permission role distribution across all paths, custom multi-join aggregations
- **Full documentation**: See `queries/cloud/exposure_graph_attack_paths.md` for detailed tool docs, parameters, examples, and 32 KQL queries

### 🔍 Resource Discovery — Cross-Subscription Lookup Pattern

**`config.json` only contains the primary Sentinel workspace subscription.** Resources investigated via Defender XDR (DeviceInfo, ExposureGraphNodes, alerts) often reside in **different subscriptions**. When you need to look up an Azure resource (VM, NSG, NIC, etc.) discovered through investigation queries:

1. Try `config.json` subscription first → `az vm list --query "[?contains(name, '<name>')]" --subscription "<config.json sub>"`
2. If not found → `az account list` to enumerate all subscriptions
3. Search each subscription until found
4. Use the discovered subscription + resource group for all subsequent ARM calls (NSG, NIC, subnet, etc.)

**Why this matters:** The Defender XDR unified portal aggregates devices across ALL connected subscriptions. A device flagged in `ExposureGraphNodes` or `DeviceInfo` may live in any subscription — the `config.json` subscription is only guaranteed to contain the Log Analytics workspace. Always specify `--subscription` explicitly in Azure CLI calls to avoid defaulting to the wrong subscription context.

### Custom Sentinel Tables

#### Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL
**Purpose:** Pre-computed sign-in anomaly detection table populated by hourly KQL job. Tracks new IPs and device combinations against 90-day baseline.

- **Anomaly Types:** `NewInteractiveIP`, `NewInteractiveDeviceCombo`, `NewNonInteractiveIP`, `NewNonInteractiveDeviceCombo`
- **Detection Model:** Compares last 1 hour activity against 90-day baseline; severity scored by artifact hit frequency + geographic novelty (`CountryNovelty`, `CityNovelty`, `StateNovelty`)
- **Key Columns:** `DetectedDateTime`, `UserPrincipalName`, `AnomalyType`, `Value`, `Severity`, `ArtifactHits`, `BaselineSize`, geographic novelty flags, `Baseline*List` arrays
- **When to Use:** Rapid anomaly triage during user investigations, impossible travel detection, token theft indicators (non-interactive anomalies with geo changes)

**Full Documentation:** See [docs/Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL.md](../docs/Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL.md) for complete schema, example queries, and severity thresholds.

## APPENDIX: Ad-Hoc Query Examples

### SecurityAlert.Status Is Immutable - Always Join SecurityIncident

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** The `Status` field on the `SecurityAlert` table is set to `"New"` at creation time and **never changes**. It does NOT reflect whether the alert has been investigated, closed, or classified.

To get the **actual investigation status**, you MUST join with `SecurityIncident`:

```kql
let relevantAlerts = SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated between (start .. end)
| where Entities has '<ENTITY>'
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by SystemAlertId
| project SystemAlertId, AlertName, AlertSeverity, ProviderName, Tactics;
SecurityIncident
| where CreatedTime between (start .. end)
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by IncidentNumber
| mv-expand AlertId = AlertIds
| extend AlertId = tostring(AlertId)
| join kind=inner relevantAlerts on $left.AlertId == $right.SystemAlertId
| summarize Title = any(Title), Severity = any(Severity), Status = any(Status),
    Classification = any(Classification), CreatedTime = any(CreatedTime)
    by ProviderIncidentId
| extend PortalUrl = strcat("https://security.microsoft.com/incidents/", ProviderIncidentId, "?tid=<TENANT_ID>")
| order by CreatedTime desc
```

> **Output rule:** When presenting these results to the user, always render `PortalUrl` as a clickable markdown link: `[#{ProviderIncidentId}]({PortalUrl})`. See [SecurityIncident Query & Output Standards](#-securityincident-query--output-standards--global-rule).

| Field | Source | Meaning |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `SecurityAlert.Status` | Alert table | **Immutable creation status** - always "New" |
| `SecurityIncident.Status` | Incident table | **Real status** - New/Active/Closed |
| `SecurityIncident.Classification` | Incident table | **Closure reason** - TruePositive/FalsePositive/BenignPositive |

**Reference:** See `queries/incidents/security_incident_analysis.md` for the canonical SecurityAlert→SecurityIncident join pattern.

---

### Queries Library — Standardized Format (`queries/`)

All query files in `queries/` MUST use this standardized metadata header for efficient `grep_search` discovery:

**Folder structure:** Query files are organized into subfolders by data domain:

| Subfolder | Domain | Examples |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `queries/identity/` | Entra ID / Azure AD | `app_credential_management.md`, `service_principal_scope_drift.md` |
| `queries/endpoint/` | Defender for Endpoint | `rare_process_chains.md`, `infostealer_hunting_campaign.md` |
| `queries/email/` | Defender for Office 365 | `email_threat_detection.md` |
| `queries/network/` | Network telemetry | `network_anomaly_detection.md` |
| `queries/cloud/` | Cloud apps & exposure | `cloudappevents_exploration.md`, `exposure_graph_attack_paths.md` |

**File naming convention:** `{topic}.md` — lowercase, underscores, no redundant suffixes like `_queries` or `_sentinel`. Keep names short and descriptive of the detection scenario or data domain. Place new files in the subfolder matching their primary data source table.

```markdown
# <Title>

**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Platform:** Microsoft Sentinel | Microsoft Defender XDR | Both  
**Tables:** <comma-separated list of exact KQL table names>  
**Keywords:** <comma-separated searchable terms — attack techniques, scenarios, field names>  
**MITRE:** <comma-separated technique IDs, e.g., T1021.001, TA0008>  
**Domains:** <comma-separated threat-pulse domain tags — see Discovery Manifest below>  
**Timeframe:** Last N days (configurable)  
```

**Required fields for search efficiency:**

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `Tables:` | Exact KQL table names for `grep_search` by table | `AuditLogs, SecurityAlert, SecurityIncident` |
| `Keywords:` | Searchable terms covering attack scenarios, operations, field names | `credential, secret, certificate, persistence, app registration` |
| `MITRE:` | ATT&CK technique and tactic IDs | `T1098.001, T1136.003, TA0003` |
| `Domains:` | Threat-pulse domain tags for manifest-based cross-referencing | `identity, email` |

Valid domain tags: `incidents`, `identity`, `spn`, `endpoint`, `email`, `admin`, `cloud`, `exposure`

**Search pattern:** `grep_search` scoped to `queries/**` with the table name or keyword will hit the metadata header and locate the right file instantly.

**When creating new query files:** Follow this format. When updating existing files that lack these fields, add them.

#### Discovery Manifest (`.github/manifests/`)

The discovery manifest indexes all query files and skills with their domain tags, enabling **deterministic cross-referencing** by threat-pulse and other skills.

Two variants are generated:
- **`discovery-manifest.yaml`** (default) — title, path, domains, mitre, prompt only. ~500 lines. **Threat-pulse loads this one** to minimize context consumption.
- **`discovery-manifest-full.yaml`** (verbose, `--full` flag) — all fields (tables, keywords, mitre, domains, platform, timeframe). ~1300 lines.

**How it works:**
- Query files declare `**Domains:**` in their metadata header
- Skills declare `threat_pulse_domains:` and `drill_down_prompt:` in their YAML frontmatter
- `python .github/manifests/build_manifest.py` scans everything and emits both manifests to `.github/manifests/`
- The validator flags missing fields — missing `Domains:` on a query file is an error

**When to regenerate:** Run `python .github/manifests/build_manifest.py` after:
- Creating or renaming a query file or skill
- Changing `Domains:`, `threat_pulse_domains:`, or `drill_down_prompt:` values
- Adding new domain tags (update `VALID_DOMAINS` in `build_manifest.py` first)

**When to regenerate TOCs:** Run `python scripts/generate_tocs.py` after creating or updating a query file. The script auto-generates a `## Quick Reference — Query Index` table with clickable anchor links for every query heading that has a KQL code block. It is idempotent — strips and regenerates existing TOCs on re-run.

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Creating a query file without `**Domains:**` | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Creating an investigation skill without `threat_pulse_domains:` | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Forgetting to run `build_manifest.py` after adding files | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Forgetting to run `generate_tocs.py` after adding/updating query files | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |

**🔴 REQUIRED: cd-metadata blocks for ALL queries in `queries/`**

Every query in a `queries/` file MUST include a `<!-- cd-metadata -->` HTML comment block immediately before the KQL code block — either `cd_ready: true` with full fields, or `cd_ready: false` with `adaptation_notes` explaining why. **Read the CD Metadata Contract in `.github/skills/detection-authoring/SKILL.md`** for the full schema, valid field values, and examples.

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Creating a query file in `queries/` without cd-metadata blocks | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |

**PII-Free Standard:** All committed documents — query files (`queries/`), skill files (`.github/skills/`), and any other versioned documentation — must NEVER contain tenant-specific PII such as real workspace names, UPNs, server hostnames, subscription/tenant GUIDs, or application names from live environments. Use generic placeholders (e.g., `<YourAppName>`, `user@contoso.com`, `<WorkspaceName>`, `la-yourworkspace`). **Before creating or updating any skill or query file, perform a PII sanity check:** scan the content for real identifiers that may have been copied from live investigation output or config files, and replace them with placeholders.

---

### IP Enrichment Utility (`enrich_ips.py`)

Use `enrich_ips.py` to enrich IP addresses with **3rd-party threat intelligence** from ipinfo.io, vpnapi.io, AbuseIPDB, and Shodan. This provides VPN/proxy/Tor detection, ISP/ASN details, hosting provider identification, abuse confidence scores, recent community-reported attack activity, open port enumeration, service/banner detection, known CVEs, and Shodan tags (e.g., honeypot, C2, self-signed).

**When to use:**
- Whenever the user asks to enrich, investigate, or check IPs
- When risky sign-ins, anomalies, or suspicious activity involve unfamiliar IP addresses
- During ad-hoc investigations, follow-up analysis, or spot-checking suspicious IPs
- Any time IP context would improve the investigation (e.g., confirming VPN usage, checking abuse history)

**When NOT to use:**
- When already executing a prescriptive skill workflow (from `.github/skills/`) that has its own built-in IP enrichment step — follow the skill's guidance instead to avoid duplication

```powershell
# Enrich specific IPs
python enrich_ips.py 203.0.113.42 198.51.100.10 192.0.2.1

# Enrich all unenriched IPs from an investigation file
python enrich_ips.py --file temp/investigation_user_20251130.json
```

**Output:** Detailed per-IP results (city, country, ISP/ASN, VPN/proxy/Tor flags, AbuseIPDB score + recent report comments) and a JSON export saved to `temp/`.

**⚠️ Output Consumption:** NEVER `read_file` the `.txt` report during long conversations — it triggers VS Code chat freezes from cumulative response size. Parse the `.json` via PowerShell (`ConvertFrom-Json | Format-Table`) instead.

---

### AH Portal Links — "Run in Advanced Hunting"

Every AH query in a `🎬 Take Action` block MUST include **both**:
1. The KQL in a **copyable fenced code block** (` ```kql ... ``` `) — the analyst copies this to paste into the AH portal
2. A **plain portal link** immediately after the code block: `[Run in Advanced Hunting](https://security.microsoft.com/v2/advanced-hunting?tid=<tenant_id>)` — opens the AH page scoped to the correct tenant; the analyst pastes the KQL there

**Tenant ID:** Read `tenant_id` from `config.json` and append `?tid=<tenant_id>` to the URL. Omit `tid` entirely if `tenant_id` is missing or a placeholder.

**🔴 DO NOT encode KQL into the URL.** The `scripts/kql_to_ah_url.py` script still exists but is **deprecated for use in output** — encoded URLs are fragile (encoding bugs, VS Code chat rendering quirks, link-length limits). Always provide the plain portal URL + copyable code block instead.

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| AH query in Take Action without a copyable KQL code block | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| AH query in Take Action without a plain `Run in Advanced Hunting` portal link | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Generating gzip/base64-encoded AH deep links via `kql_to_ah_url.py` for output | ❌ **PROHIBITED** |
| Every AH query in Take Action includes BOTH a code block AND a plain `?tid=<tenant_id>` portal link | ✅ **REQUIRED** |

---

### Enumerating User Permissions and Roles

When asked to check permissions or roles for a user account, **ALWAYS query BOTH**:

1. **Permanent Role Assignments** (active roles)
2. **PIM-Eligible Roles** (roles that can be activated on-demand)

**Step 1: Get User Object ID**
```
/v1.0/users/<UPN>?$select=id
```

**Step 2: Get Permanent Role Assignments**
```
/v1.0/roleManagement/directory/roleAssignments?$select=principalId&$filter=principalId eq '<USER_ID>'&$expand=roleDefinition($select=templateId,displayName,description)
```

**Step 3: Get PIM-Eligible Roles**
```
/v1.0/roleManagement/directory/roleEligibilityScheduleInstances?$select=memberType,startDateTime,endDateTime&$filter=principalId eq '<USER_ID>'&$expand=principal($select=id),roleDefinition($select=id,displayName,description)
```

**Step 4: Get Active PIM Role Assignments (time-bounded)**
```
/v1.0/roleManagement/directory/roleAssignmentScheduleInstances?$select=assignmentType,memberType,startDateTime,endDateTime&$filter=principalId eq '<USER_ID>' and startDateTime le <CURRENT_DATETIME> and endDateTime ge <CURRENT_DATETIME>&$expand=principal($select=id),roleDefinition($select=id,displayName,description)
```

**Example Output Format:**
```
Total Role Inventory for <USER>:

Permanent Active Roles (X):
1. Global Administrator
2. Security Administrator
...

PIM-Eligible Roles (Y):
1. Exchange Administrator (Eligible since: <date>, Expiration: <date or ∞>)
2. Intune Administrator (Eligible since: <date>, Expiration: <date or ∞>)
...

Active PIM Role Assignments (Z):
1. [Role Name] (Activated: <start>, Expires: <end>, Assignment Type: <type>)
...
```

**Security Analysis Guidance:**
- Flag if high-privilege roles (Global Admin, Security Admin, Application Admin) are **permanently assigned** instead of PIM-eligible
- Recommend converting permanent privileged roles to PIM-eligible with approval workflows
- Note if PIM eligibilities have no expiration (should be reviewed periodically)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Graph API returns 404 for entity** | Verify UPN/ID is correct; check if entity exists with different identifier |
| **Sentinel query timeout** | Reduce date range or add `| take 100` to limit results |
| **`RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` returns "An error occurred invoking"** | Wrong parameter name — use **`kqlQuery`**, NOT `query`. This is the #1 silent failure mode for AH calls. |
| **KQL syntax error** | Validate query with `validate_kql_query` tool before execution |
| **SemanticError: Failed to resolve column** | Field doesn't exist in table schema - use `get_table_schema` to check valid columns |
| **SemanticError: Failed to resolve table** | Table not in Data Lake - try `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` instead |
| **Dynamic field errors (DeviceDetail, LocationDetails)** | Use `tostring()` wrapper or `parse_json()` to extract values |
| **Risky sign-ins query fails** | Must use `/beta` endpoint, not `/v1.0` |
| **Multiple workspaces available** | Follow SENTINEL WORKSPACE SELECTION rule - ask user to choose |
