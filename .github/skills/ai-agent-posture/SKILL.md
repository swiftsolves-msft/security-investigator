# AI Agent Security Posture — Instructions

## Purpose

This skill audits the **security posture of AI agents** (Copilot Studio, Microsoft 365 Copilot / Agent Builder, Microsoft Foundry, and third-party platforms) across your organization using the `AgentsInfo` table in Microsoft Defender XDR Advanced Hunting.

> **🔄 Table migration (AIAgentsInfo → AgentsInfo):** This skill was migrated from the deprecated `AIAgentsInfo` table to the unified multi-platform `AgentsInfo` table. `AIAgentsInfo` remains queryable until **July 1, 2026**, but it is Copilot Studio-only and uses a different schema. All queries in this skill target `AgentsInfo`. The new table is a **different data model**, not a rename — see [Table Schema Reference](#table-schema-reference) and [Known Pitfalls](#known-pitfalls) for the differences that shaped these queries.

AI agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous applications that can access organizational data, send emails, call external APIs, and use MCP tools. Misconfigured agents — missing authentication, overly broad access, AI-controlled email sending, hard-coded credentials — represent a growing attack surface. This skill systematically evaluates that surface.

**What this skill covers:**

| Domain | Key Questions Answered |
|--------|----------------------|
| 🔍 **Agent Inventory** | How many agents exist? What's their status, platform, environment? |
| 🔐 **Access Posture** | Which agents are broadly accessible (`allowForAllUsers`)? How are agents shared (`appType`: lob/shared)? |
| 🛠️ **Tools & MCP** | Which agents have MCP tools? What operations can they perform? |
| 📚 **Knowledge Sources** | What data sources are agents connected to? |
| 📧 **XPIA Email Risk** | Which agents can send email (data exfil precondition)? |
| 🔑 **Credential Exposure** | Are credentials hard-coded in agent instructions or connector metadata? |
| 🌐 **External Endpoint Risk** | What external hosts do agent connectors reach? Any insecure schemes or non-standard ports? |
| 👥 **Creator Governance** | Who creates agents? Is there naming hygiene? Abandoned agents? |

## Threat Landscape: Why AI Agent Posture Matters

Microsoft Defender Security Research has identified that AI agents represent a **fundamentally new attack surface** where the agent's capabilities are effectively equivalent to code execution. When a tool is invoked, it can read/write data, send emails, update records, or trigger workflows — and an attacker who can influence the agent's plan can indirectly cause the execution of unintended operations within the agent's capability sandbox.

The core risk: **the agent's orchestrator depends on natural language input to determine which tools to use and how to use them.** This creates exposure to prompt injection and reprogramming failures, where malicious prompts, embedded instructions, or crafted documents can manipulate the decision-making process.

This skill's queries map directly to three attack scenarios documented by Microsoft:

### Attack Scenario 1: Malicious Instruction Injection via Event-Triggered Workflow

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Vector** | Crafted email sent to an agent-monitored mailbox (event trigger) |
| **Mechanism** | Email contains hidden instructions telling the agent to search knowledge base for sensitive data and exfiltrate via email to attacker |
| **Preconditions** | Agent can send email (email connector) + has an event/email trigger + a knowledge source |
| **Detection** | Q5 (XPIA Email Risk) detects email-capable agents via connector operations; Q7 (Knowledge Sources) identifies data exposure |
| **Skill Signal** | Agents with an email-send operation (e.g., `Office 365 Outlook Send an email (V2)`) + knowledge sources, especially if broadly accessible (`allowForAllUsers == "true"`) = highest risk |

### Attack Scenario 2: Prompt Injection via Shared Document → Email Exfiltration (XPIA)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Vector** | Malicious insider edits a SharePoint document with crafted instructions |
| **Mechanism** | Agent processing the document is tricked into reading a sensitive file on a different SharePoint site (that the agent has access to but the attacker doesn't) and emailing contents to attacker-controlled domain |
| **Preconditions** | Agent has a knowledge/data source + an email-send connector operation |
| **Detection** | Q5 (XPIA) + Q7 (Knowledge Sources) identifies the attack surface |
| **Skill Signal** | A declared data source + an email-send operation (e.g., `Send an email (V2)`) on the same agent = classic XPIA vector |

### Attack Scenario 3: Capability Reconnaissance on Unauthenticated Agent

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Vector** | Attacker interacts with publicly accessible chatbot (no authentication required) |
| **Mechanism** | Series of crafted prompts to probe and enumerate the agent's tools and knowledge sources, then exploit them to extract sensitive data |
| **Preconditions** | Agent is broadly accessible (`allowForAllUsers == "true"`, e.g., shared tenant-wide or website embed) |
| **Detection** | Q4 (Broadly-Accessible Agents) identifies exposed agents; cross-reference with Q7 (knowledge sources with customer data) |
| **Skill Signal** | `allowForAllUsers == "true"` + knowledge sources containing sensitive data = reconnaissance target |

> **⚠️ Authentication-type telemetry gap:** The deprecated `AIAgentsInfo` table exposed `UserAuthenticationType` (`None`/`Integrated`/`Custom`), which let this skill directly flag *unauthenticated* agents. The new `AgentsInfo` table has **no populated authentication-type column** in current telemetry (`ToolsAuthenticationType` is empty). The closest available exposure signal is `RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers == "true"` (broadly accessible to all tenant users). This is a **proxy, not an equivalent** — it measures broad reach, not absence of authentication. Treat broadly-accessible agents as the highest-exposure cohort and recommend Entra-based access policies (Agent 365) to close the gap.

### Mitigation: Defender Runtime Protection

Microsoft Defender provides **webhook-based runtime inspection** for Copilot Studio agents. Before every tool, topic, or knowledge action is executed, the generative orchestrator sends a webhook to Defender containing the planned invocation context. Defender analyzes intent and destination in real time and can **allow or block** the action before execution.

This is the primary runtime defense against all three scenarios above. When reviewing posture findings from this skill, **always recommend enabling Defender Runtime Protection** for agents flagged as high-risk. See [Real-time agent protection during runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/real-time-agent-protection-during-runtime).

### Governance Framework: Microsoft Agent 365

[Microsoft Agent 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-agent-365-the-control-plane-for-ai-agents/) is the enterprise **control plane** for AI agents — the platform-level answer to the governance gaps this skill detects. It provides five capabilities that directly map to this skill's risk dimensions:

| Agent 365 Capability | What It Does | Skill Dimensions Addressed |
|---------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **1. Registry** | Single source of truth for all agents (Entra agent ID). IT can quarantine unsanctioned agents and detect shadow agents. Agent Store for governed discovery. | Agent Inventory (Q1), Creator Governance (Q10), Agent Sprawl (Q11) |
| **2. Access Control** | Unique agent IDs via Entra. Agent Policy Templates enforce security from day one. Adaptive, risk-based access policies. Least-privilege enforcement. | Broadly-Accessible Agents (Q4), Access Posture (Q3) |
| **3. Visualization** | Unified dashboard mapping agents ↔ users ↔ resources. Role-based reporting. Compliance logging, e-discovery, and audit trail. | MCP Tool Exposure (Q6), Knowledge Sources (Q7), Creator Governance (Q10) |
| **4. Interoperability** | Agents access Work IQ (org data, relationships, context). Works across Copilot Studio, Microsoft Foundry, Agent Framework, Agent 365 SDK, and partner platforms. | Knowledge Source Risk (Q7), Tools Inventory (Q12) |
| **5. Security** | Defense-in-depth via Microsoft Defender (posture + threat detection + runtime protection), Entra (real-time blocking), and Purview (data exposure risk, sensitive data leak prevention, compliance). | XPIA Email Risk (Q5), Credential Hygiene (Q8), External Endpoint Risk (Q9) |

**How to reference Agent 365 in reports:** When this skill identifies governance gaps (sprawl, missing authentication, uncontrolled tool access), recommend Agent 365 as the strategic platform to address them. Specific mappings:

- **Agent sprawl / no naming conventions** → Agent 365 Registry + quarantine for unsanctioned agents
- **Missing access controls / broadly-accessible agents** → Agent 365 Access Control + Entra agent IDs + Policy Templates
- **No visibility into agent-resource connections** → Agent 365 Visualization dashboard
- **Uncontrolled MCP/tool proliferation** → Agent 365 Security + Defender posture management
- **XPIA / data exfiltration risk** → Agent 365 Security + Purview for real-time data leak prevention

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️

1. **ALWAYS use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`** — The `AgentsInfo` table is an Advanced Hunting table. It is NOT available in Sentinel Data Lake (`query_lake`). All queries in this skill MUST use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`.

2. **ALWAYS deduplicate agents with `arg_max`** — The table contains multiple records per agent (state snapshots over time). Every query that analyzes current agent state MUST use `| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId` to get the latest record per agent. Note `AgentId` is a **guid**.

3. **ALWAYS exclude deleted agents** (unless specifically auditing deletions) — Add `| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"` after deduplication. `LifecycleStatus` is blank for active agents and only set to `Deleted` for removed ones, so this filter keeps active agents.

4. **ASK the user for output format** before generating the report:
   - **Inline chat summary** (quick review in chat)
   - **Markdown file report** (detailed, archived to `reports/ai-agent-posture/`)
   - **Both** (markdown + inline summary)

5. **⛔ MANDATORY: Evidence-based analysis only** — Report ONLY what query results show. Use the explicit absence pattern (`✅ No [finding] detected`) when queries return 0 results. Never guess or assume.

6. **🔴 The rich agent detail lives in `RawAgentInfo` (dynamic), not in flat columns** — Governance signals (`creatorId`, `allowForAllUsers`, `appType`, `scope`) and deep tool/connector detail (`declarativeCopilotMetadata`) are nested inside the `RawAgentInfo` dynamic column. The normalized columns (`DeclaredTools`, `McpServers`, `DeclaredDataSources`) are sparse and flat. Parse `RawAgentInfo` with `mv-expand`/dot-notation — never assume a flat column holds the value. See [Known Pitfalls](#known-pitfalls).

7. **Run queries in parallel batches** where possible — Phase 1 queries (Q1–Q3) are independent and can run in parallel. Phase 2 queries (Q4–Q9) are independent and can run in parallel. Phase 3 (Q10–Q12) can run in parallel.

8. **Time tracking** — Report elapsed time after each phase completion.

---

## Table Schema Reference

The `AgentsInfo` table (Preview) contains configuration snapshots of AI agents across Copilot Studio, Microsoft 365 Copilot (Agent Builder), Microsoft Foundry, and third-party platforms. The schema below reflects the **live table** (which differs from the published docs in several places — column casing, types, and which columns are actually populated).

### Top-level columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `Timestamp` | datetime | Last recorded date/time for this agent snapshot |
| `AgentId` | guid | Unique agent identifier (dedup key) |
| `Name` | string | Display name of the agent |
| `Description` | string | Agent description |
| `Platform` | string | `Copilot Studio`, `Agent Builder in Microsoft 365 Copilot`, `Microsoft Foundry`, `Other`, `SharePoint`, `Amazon Bedrock`, `LocalAgents` |
| `Version` | string | Agent version |
| `PublishedStatus` | string | `Published`, `Draft` |
| `LifecycleStatus` | string | Blank for active agents; `Deleted` for removed agents |
| `CreatedDateTime` | datetime | When the agent was created |
| `LastUpdatedDateTime` | datetime | When last updated |
| `LastPublishedDateTime` | datetime | When last published |
| `Owners` | dynamic | Owner identities (sparse) |
| `SharedWith` | dynamic | Sharing targets (sparse) |
| `InstanceCount` | int | Blueprint instance count |
| `Instructions` | string | System prompt / agent instructions (well populated) |
| `Model` | string | Backing LLM model (sparse) |
| `Capabilities` | dynamic | Declared capabilities (sparse) |
| `DeclaredDataSources` | dynamic | Knowledge/data sources — array of filename/source strings (sparse) |
| `DeclaredTools` | dynamic | Declared tools — array of `{type, name}` (sparse, flat) |
| `McpServers` | dynamic | MCP servers — array of `{name, description}` (sparse) |
| `Skills`, `ConnectedAgents`, `Memory`, `Guardrails` | dynamic | Additional declared config (sparse) |
| `EntraAgentID` / `EntraBlueprintID` / `ObservabilityID` | string | Entra + observability linkage (note capital `ID`) |
| `RawAgentInfo` | dynamic | **Primary detail source** — full governance + connector manifest (populated for ~all agents). See nested keys below |
| `TenantId`, `Type`, `SourceSystem` | string | Standard envelope columns |

### ⚠️ Columns that are EMPTY / unreliable in current telemetry

These columns exist but are **not populated** in observed data — do NOT build detections on them without first confirming population:

`ToolsAuthenticationType` (auth-type gap — see below), `Availability`, `Endpoints`, `Triggers`, `Permissions`, `Model` (mostly), and most of `Owners`/`SharedWith`.

> **🔴 Authentication-type gap:** The deprecated `AIAgentsInfo.UserAuthenticationType` (`None`/`Integrated`/`Custom`) has **no populated equivalent** in `AgentsInfo`. There is no reliable way to flag "unauthenticated" agents from this table. Use `RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers == "true"` as a broad-exposure proxy (Q4) and document the gap.

### `RawAgentInfo` nested keys (the rich data)

For Copilot Studio agents, `RawAgentInfo` is a marketplace/governance manifest. Key fields the queries below rely on:

| Path | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `RawAgentInfo.creatorId` | Creator **GUID** (resolve to UPN via `IdentityInfo` join). Replaces `CreatorAccountUpn`. Sparse |
| `RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers` | `"true"` = broadly accessible to all tenant users (exposure signal). Replaces `AccessControlPolicy == "Any"` |
| `RawAgentInfo.appType` | `lob` (line-of-business, owner-scoped), `shared`, `thirdParty`, `firstParty` |
| `RawAgentInfo.scope` | Sharing scope (e.g., `tenant`) |
| `RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata` | **Deep connector/tool detail** (DCM). Present only for the connector-sourced subset (~10% of Copilot Studio agents) |

**DCM nesting** (recovers deep tool, operation, and endpoint detail):

```
RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata[]
  .actions[]
    .apis[]            // .type = OpenApi | RemoteMCPServer | api_action
      .serverUrls[]    // populated for OpenApi + RemoteMCPServer (external hosts)
      .operations[]
        .operationId   // e.g., "Office 365 Outlook Send an email (V2)"
```

DCM siblings also carry `instructions`, `llmModels` (model), and `sourceIds` (incl. `EnvironmentId`, `SourceAgentId`).

---

## Agent Security Score Formula

The Agent Security Score is a composite risk indicator that summarizes the security posture of an organization's AI agent fleet. Higher scores indicate greater risk.

### Scoring Dimensions

$$
\text{AgentSecurityScore} = \sum_{i} \text{DimensionScore}_i
$$

Each dimension contributes 0–20 points to a maximum of 100:

| Dimension | Max | 🟢 Low (0–5) | 🟡 Medium (6–12) | 🔴 High (13–20) |
|-----------|-----|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Broadly-Accessible Agents** | 20 | 0 agents with `allowForAllUsers == "true"` | 1–2 broadly-accessible agents | ≥3 broadly-accessible agents, especially if Published with knowledge sources or email capability |
| **XPIA Email Risk** | 20 | 0 email-capable agents | 1–2 email-capable agents (scoped access) | ≥1 email-capable agent that is also broadly accessible or has knowledge sources |
| **Tool & Endpoint Exposure** | 20 | 0–2 MCP agents, known creators, no external endpoints | 3–10 MCP agents, external endpoints all HTTPS/standard-port | >10 MCP agents, OR MCP/endpoint agents that are broadly accessible, OR any insecure-scheme / non-standard-port external endpoint (Q9 escalators) |
| **Knowledge Source Risk** | 20 | 0 agents with data sources + broad access | 1–3 agents with data sources + scoped access | Agents with data sources + `allowForAllUsers == "true"`. **Compounding rule:** When agents have data sources + an email-send operation + broad access (the full XPIA chain from Q5 + Q7), score at maximum (20) for this dimension AND score XPIA Email Risk at maximum (20) — the combination is the documented attack pattern |
| **Credential Hygiene** | 20 | 0 credential patterns detected | Patterns found but agent is Draft (unpublished) | Patterns found in Published agents |

### Interpretation Scale

| Score | Rating | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **0–20** | ✅ Healthy | Normal posture, no immediate concerns |
| **21–45** | 🟡 Elevated | Review — minor misconfigurations detected |
| **46–70** | 🟠 Concerning | Investigate — multiple risk signals present |
| **71–100** | 🔴 Critical | Immediate remediation — significant agent security risk |

> The **Tool & Endpoint Exposure** dimension folds external-endpoint risk (Q9) into the MCP exposure signal: an insecure scheme, a non-standard port, or an external endpoint on a broadly-accessible agent each escalates this dimension to its High tier regardless of MCP count.

### Supplementary Indicators (not summed into the /100 score)

Two indicators are reported **alongside** the composite score for added context. They are intentionally **not** added to the /100 total — they enrich interpretation and feed the dimensions above as evidence.

| Indicator | Source | What it tells you |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Capability Privilege Index** | Q13 | Count of agents holding ≥1 *sensitive* operation (mail-send, directory-write, data-write, messaging). Split by broad access. A high count of broadly-accessible + sensitive-op agents is the strongest privilege-abuse signal and should justify maxing the Broad Access and/or XPIA dimensions. |
| **Deep-Manifest Coverage** | Q14 | Percentage of the fleet carrying `declarativeCopilotMetadata` (DCM). Because the XPIA, endpoint, and capability queries depend on DCM, this is the fraction of the estate that was *fully* inspectable. Every report MUST surface this so the analyst knows what was **not** inspected. |

---

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 0: Prerequisites

1. Confirm `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` is available (AgentsInfo is AH-only)
2. Ask user for output format (inline / markdown / both)

### Phase 1: Inventory & Overview (Q1–Q3)

**Run in parallel — no dependencies between queries.**

| Query | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Q1 | Global inventory summary (counts, date range, platforms, creators) |
| Q2 | Status and platform breakdown |
| Q3 | Access posture distribution (`appType` / `allowForAllUsers`) |

### Phase 2: Security Risk Analysis (Q4–Q9)

**Run in parallel — no dependencies between queries.**

| Query | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Q4 | Broadly-accessible agents (`allowForAllUsers == "true"` detail) |
| Q5 | XPIA email exfiltration risk (email-send connector operations) |
| Q6 | MCP tool inventory across agents |
| Q7 | Knowledge / data source audit |
| Q8 | Hard-coded credential scan |
| Q9 | External endpoint & HTTP risk (connector `serverUrls`) |

### Phase 3: Governance & Trends (Q10–Q12)

**Run in parallel — no dependencies between queries.**

| Query | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Q10 | Top creators and naming hygiene |
| Q11 | Agent creation trend over time |
| Q12 | Capability / tools inventory (all operation types) |
| Q13 | Operation-level privilege mapping (sensitive-operation matrix → Capability Privilege Index) |
| Q14 | Deep-manifest coverage (% of fleet with DCM → report coverage banner) |

### Phase 4: Score Computation & Report Generation

1. **Compute per-dimension scores** from Phase 1–3 data
2. **Sum dimension scores** for composite Agent Security Score
3. **Generate report** in requested output mode
4. **Report total elapsed time**

### Phase 5: Runtime Correlation (Optional)

`AgentsInfo` describes how agents are **configured**; it does not show whether they are actually **used** or what they do at runtime. To close that gap, correlate the *flagged* configuration set against the `CopilotActivity` table (all-surface AI activity log, available in Advanced Hunting).

**When to run:** After Phase 4, when the user wants to know which *flagged* agents are actually active, which are dormant, or whether a high-risk agent shows runtime behavior.

**🔴 Use a SCOPED lookup, never a fleet-wide join.** A `leftouter`/`inner` join of the full `AgentsInfo` fleet (~15k agents, heavy `RawAgentInfo` dynamic) against `CopilotActivity` (100k+ rows) **times out** the Advanced Hunting endpoint. Instead:

1. **Phase 4 produces a small flagged-agent NAME list** (broadly-accessible from Q4 + sensitive-op agents from Q13 — typically <50 names).
2. **Filter `CopilotActivity` to that name set** with `where AgentName in (FlaggedNames)` — light, no join. See Query 15.

**Join-key pitfall:** `CopilotActivity.AgentId` is a **composite/prefixed string** (e.g., `T_<tenant>.<guid>`, `CopilotStudio.Declarative.T_….gpt.<guid>`, or literals like `AgentBuilder`) — it does **not** equal the clean `AgentsInfo.AgentId` GUID, so ID-based joins return 0 matches. **`AgentName` is the reliable correlation key.** Also note most `CopilotActivity` rows have an **empty** `AgentId`/`AgentName` (general M365 Copilot usage, not declarative-agent-attributed), so runtime attribution is inherently low-coverage — absence from `CopilotActivity` does NOT prove an agent is dormant.

**Two high-value correlations:**
- **Active-and-dangerous** — a flagged agent (broadly accessible / XPIA-exposed / sensitive ops) that ALSO appears in `CopilotActivity` with real interactions → **highest remediation priority** (Query 15).
- **Configured-but-dormant** — a flagged agent absent from `CopilotActivity` over the window → lower urgency, candidate for decommissioning (caveat: attribution gaps above).

For deeper runtime reconstruction (data accessed, tools invoked, jailbreak detections), hand off to the dedicated query library **`queries/cloud/copilot_activity_investigation.md`** rather than duplicating queries here.

> Keep this phase thin and scoped: the posture skill owns *configuration* assessment; `copilot_activity_investigation.md` owns *runtime* reconstruction. Reference, don't duplicate.

---

## Sample KQL Queries

> **All queries below are validated against the live `AgentsInfo` table. Use them exactly as written, substituting only where noted.** Because the rich agent detail lives in the `RawAgentInfo` dynamic column, several queries parse `RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata` (DCM). DCM is present only for the connector-sourced subset of agents — queries that depend on it carry a **coverage caveat**.

### Query 1: Global Inventory Summary

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| extend CreatorId = tostring(RawAgentInfo.creatorId)
| summarize
    UniqueAgents = dcount(AgentId),
    EarliestRecord = min(Timestamp),
    LatestRecord = max(Timestamp),
    Published = countif(PublishedStatus == "Published"),
    Draft = countif(PublishedStatus == "Draft"),
    Deleted = countif(LifecycleStatus == "Deleted"),
    UniquePlatforms = dcount(Platform),
    UniqueCreators = dcount(CreatorId)
```

> **Note:** `UniqueCreators` counts only agents with a populated `RawAgentInfo.creatorId` (the connector-sourced subset). It under-counts true creators; treat it as a lower bound.

### Query 2: Status & Platform Breakdown

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| summarize AgentCount = count() by Platform, PublishedStatus
| order by AgentCount desc
```

> **⚠️ Authentication-type gap:** The deprecated `AIAgentsInfo` table broke this down by `UserAuthenticationType`. `AgentsInfo` has no populated authentication-type column, so this query reports status by **platform** instead. For exposure, use Q3 (access posture) and Q4 (broadly-accessible agents).

### Query 3: Access Posture Distribution

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| extend AppType = tostring(RawAgentInfo.appType),
         AllowAllUsers = tostring(RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers)
| summarize AgentCount = count() by Platform, AppType, AllowAllUsers
| order by AgentCount desc
```

**Interpretation:** `appType == "lob"` (line-of-business) agents are owner-scoped; `appType == "shared"` are shared more widely. `allowForAllUsers == "true"` (any platform) is the broad-exposure signal — these reach every tenant user. This replaces the old `AccessControlPolicy` distribution.

### Query 4: Broadly-Accessible Agents

🔴 **Security-critical query** — agents with `allowForAllUsers == "true"` are accessible to all tenant users. This is the closest available proxy for the old "unauthenticated / Any access" exposure signal (see the [authentication-type gap](#-columns-that-are-empty--unreliable-in-current-telemetry)).

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| extend AllowAllUsers = tostring(RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers),
         AppType = tostring(RawAgentInfo.appType),
         CreatorId = tostring(RawAgentInfo.creatorId)
| where AllowAllUsers == "true"
| project Name, Platform, PublishedStatus, AppType, CreatorId, AgentId, CreatedDateTime, Description
| order by PublishedStatus asc, CreatedDateTime desc
```

**Post-processing:** For each broadly-accessible agent, note:
- Is it Published (active) or Draft?
- Cross-reference with Q5 (email-capable) and Q7 (knowledge sources) for compounding XPIA / reconnaissance risk.

**🔴 Capability Reconnaissance Risk ([Attack Scenario 3](#attack-scenario-3-capability-reconnaissance-on-unauthenticated-agent)):** Broadly-accessible agents are prime targets for adversarial probing. Published agents with knowledge sources containing customer/internal data are the highest-priority findings.

### Query 5: XPIA Email Exfiltration Risk (Email-Capable Agents)

🔴 **Security-critical query** — agents that can send email via a connector operation. A successful prompt-injection (XPIA) attack could direct the agent to exfiltrate data to arbitrary recipients.

> **Coverage caveat:** Detects email-send operations declared in `RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata` (DCM). DCM is present only for the connector-sourced agent subset. The old `IsGenerativeOrchestrationEnabled` flag and action-level `inputs` (AI-controlled vs hardcoded recipient) are **not available** in `AgentsInfo` — this query identifies *capability*, not orchestration mode.

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| where isnotempty(tostring(RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata))
| mv-expand DCM = RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata
| mv-expand Action = DCM.actions
| mv-expand Api = Action.apis
| mv-expand Op = Api.operations
| extend OperationId = tostring(Op.operationId)
| where OperationId has "Send an email" or OperationId has "SendEmail"
| extend AllowAllUsers = tostring(RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers),
         CreatorId = tostring(RawAgentInfo.creatorId)
| summarize EmailOperations = make_set(OperationId)
    by AgentId, Name, Platform, PublishedStatus, AllowAllUsers, CreatorId
| order by AllowAllUsers desc, PublishedStatus asc
```

**Post-processing:**
- `AllowAllUsers == "true"` → email-capable **and** broadly accessible = **highest XPIA risk** (any tenant user can trigger the chain).
- **Cross-reference with Q7:** an email-capable agent that also has knowledge/data sources is the **documented XPIA exfiltration pattern** ([Attack Scenario 2](#attack-scenario-2-prompt-injection-via-shared-document--email-exfiltration-xpia)). Prioritize these for Defender Runtime Protection.

**🔴 Attack Scenario Mapping:** This query detects the agent-configuration precondition (email-send capability) for two documented scenarios — [Malicious Instruction Injection via Event Trigger](#attack-scenario-1-malicious-instruction-injection-via-event-triggered-workflow) and [Prompt Injection via Shared Document](#attack-scenario-2-prompt-injection-via-shared-document--email-exfiltration-xpia). Broadly-accessible email-capable agents (no access restriction + email) are the most dangerous.

### Query 6: MCP Tool Inventory Across Agents

🟠 **Governance query** — MCP servers give agents access to external systems, Graph API, Sentinel data, and more. Uncontrolled MCP proliferation increases the attack surface. `AgentsInfo` exposes a dedicated `McpServers` column (cleaner than the old tool-detail parse).

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| where array_length(McpServers) > 0
| mv-expand Mcp = McpServers
| extend McpName = tostring(Mcp.name)
| extend CreatorId = tostring(RawAgentInfo.creatorId),
         AllowAllUsers = tostring(RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers)
| summarize McpServerList = make_set(McpName), McpToolCount = dcount(McpName)
    by AgentId, Name, Platform, CreatorId, AllowAllUsers
| order by McpToolCount desc
```

**MCP server distribution** (which servers appear on the most agents):

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| where array_length(McpServers) > 0
| mv-expand Mcp = McpServers
| summarize AgentCount = dcount(AgentId) by McpServer = tostring(Mcp.name)
| order by AgentCount desc
```

> **Note:** `McpServers` is flat (`{name, description}` only) — no server URLs or credential config. For external MCP **endpoint** detail (host/scheme/port), use Q9, which parses `RemoteMCPServer` `serverUrls` from DCM.

### Query 7: Knowledge / Data Source Audit

🟡 **Data exposure query** — identifies what data sources agents declare. In `AgentsInfo`, declared sources appear in the `DeclaredDataSources` column as an array of source/filename strings.

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| where array_length(DeclaredDataSources) > 0
| mv-expand DS = DeclaredDataSources
| extend DataSource = tostring(DS)
| extend AllowAllUsers = tostring(RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers),
         CreatorId = tostring(RawAgentInfo.creatorId)
| summarize DataSources = make_set(DataSource), SourceCount = dcount(DataSource)
    by AgentId, Name, Platform, AllowAllUsers, CreatorId
| order by SourceCount desc
```

**Post-processing — flag high-risk combinations:**
- Data sources + `allowForAllUsers == "true"` → internal data potentially exposed broadly.
- Any data source on an agent that is also email-capable (Q5) → XPIA exfiltration chain.

> **Coverage caveat:** `DeclaredDataSources` is sparse and stores source **names/filenames** (e.g., `Priority-Banking-Policy.docx`), not the richer `$kind`/site structure the old `KnowledgeDetails` column held. Source *type* classification (SharePoint vs public site vs federated) is not reliably available — report the declared source names and flag broadly-accessible agents that carry any.

**🔴 Document Injection Risk ([Attack Scenario 2](#attack-scenario-2-prompt-injection-via-shared-document--email-exfiltration-xpia)):** Data sources are the primary vector for indirect prompt injection (XPIA). **Cross-reference with Q5:** agents that combine declared data sources with an email-send operation are the textbook XPIA exfiltration pattern — flag these as **highest priority** in the Knowledge Source Risk dimension.

### Query 8: Hard-Coded Credential Scan

🔴 **Security-critical query** — scans agent `Instructions` and the connector metadata in `RawAgentInfo` for patterns matching API keys, JWTs, Basic auth headers, and embedded credentials.

```kql
let suspicious_patterns = @"(AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16})|(AIza[0-9A-Za-z_\-]{35})|(xox[baprs]-[0-9a-zA-Z]{10,48})|(ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]{36,59})|(sk_(live|test)_[A-Za-z0-9]{24})|(SG\.[A-Za-z0-9]{22}\.[A-Za-z0-9]{43})|(eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_\-]+\.[A-Za-z0-9_\-]+\.[A-Za-z0-9_\-]+)|(Authorization\s*:\s*Basic\s+[A-Za-z0-9=:+]+)|([A-Za-z]+:\/\/[^\/\s]+:[^\/\s]+@[^\/\s]+)";
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| extend Haystack = strcat(tostring(Instructions), " ", tostring(RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata))
| where Haystack matches regex suspicious_patterns
| project Name, Platform, PublishedStatus,
          CreatorId = tostring(RawAgentInfo.creatorId), AgentId
```

**Post-processing:**
- Published agents with credential matches = **immediate remediation required**.
- Recommend Azure Key Vault + environment variables instead of hard-coded secrets.
- The JWT (`eyJ...`) and `url://user:pass@host` patterns can false-positive on example payloads — manually review each match.

### Query 9: External Endpoint & HTTP Risk

🟠 **Network risk query** — inventories the external hosts that agent connectors reach, and flags insecure schemes or non-standard ports. External endpoints are declared in DCM `apis[].serverUrls` for `OpenApi` and `RemoteMCPServer` connector types (these are populated; `api_action` Power Platform connectors abstract the URL and are not covered).

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| where isnotempty(tostring(RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata))
| mv-expand DCM = RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata
| mv-expand Action = DCM.actions
| mv-expand Api = Action.apis
| extend ApiType = tostring(Api.type)
| where ApiType in ("OpenApi", "RemoteMCPServer")
| mv-expand Url = Api.serverUrls
| extend Url = tostring(Url)
| where isnotempty(Url)
| extend Host = tostring(parse_url(Url).Host),
         Port = tostring(parse_url(Url).Port),
         Scheme = tostring(parse_url(Url).Scheme)
| extend NonStandardPort = isnotempty(Port) and Port !in ("443", "80", ""),
         InsecureScheme = Scheme != "https"
| project Name, Platform, ApiType, Scheme, Host, Port, Url,
          NonStandardPort, InsecureScheme,
          AllowAllUsers = tostring(RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers)
| order by NonStandardPort desc, InsecureScheme desc, Host asc
```

**Post-processing:**
- `InsecureScheme == true` (non-HTTPS) or `NonStandardPort == true` → review the connector; data may transit insecurely.
- Unfamiliar external hosts on broadly-accessible agents (`AllowAllUsers == "true"`) → highest priority.

> **Coverage caveat:** Only `OpenApi` + `RemoteMCPServer` connectors declare `serverUrls`. Power Platform `api_action` connectors (the majority) do not expose a URL here, so their destinations are not inventoried by this query. The old topic-level `HttpRequestAction` parsing is not applicable to `AgentsInfo`.

### Query 10: Top Creators & Naming Hygiene

👥 **Governance query** — identifies prolific agent creators and names lacking descriptiveness. Creator is a GUID in `RawAgentInfo.creatorId`; resolve to UPN via an `IdentityInfo` join.

```kql
let IdMap = materialize(IdentityInfo
    | where isnotempty(AccountObjectId) and isnotempty(AccountUpn)
    | distinct AccountObjectId, AccountUpn);
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| extend CreatorId = tostring(RawAgentInfo.creatorId)
| where isnotempty(CreatorId)
| join kind=leftouter IdMap on $left.CreatorId == $right.AccountObjectId
| extend CreatorUpn = coalesce(AccountUpn, CreatorId)
| summarize
    AgentCount = count(),
    PublishedCount = countif(PublishedStatus == "Published"),
    GenericNameCount = countif(Name in~ ("Agent", "agent", "Test", "test", "New Agent")),
    NoDescriptionCount = countif(isempty(Description)),
    AgentNames = make_set(Name, 10)
    by CreatorUpn
| order by AgentCount desc
| take 20
```

> **Coverage caveat:** Only agents with a populated `RawAgentInfo.creatorId` are attributed. Creators whose GUID does not resolve in `IdentityInfo` fall back to the raw GUID. A single creator with a very high `AgentCount` is a sprawl signal worth investigating.

### Query 11: Agent Creation Trend

📈 **Trend query** — shows agent creation velocity over time to detect sprawl acceleration.

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| where isnotempty(CreatedDateTime)
| summarize AgentsCreated = count() by bin(CreatedDateTime, 7d)
| order by CreatedDateTime asc
```

### Query 12: Full Capability / Tools Inventory

🛠️ **Tools governance query** — catalogs the operations agents can invoke across all connector types, to understand the full capability surface. Parses DCM operations (`operationId` + API `type`).

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| where isnotempty(tostring(RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata))
| mv-expand DCM = RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata
| mv-expand Action = DCM.actions
| mv-expand Api = Action.apis
| mv-expand Op = Api.operations
| extend OperationId = tostring(Op.operationId), ApiType = tostring(Api.type)
| where isnotempty(OperationId)
| summarize AgentCount = dcount(AgentId), Agents = make_set(Name, 5) by OperationId, ApiType
| order by AgentCount desc
```

**Alternative for non-DCM agents** — the flat `DeclaredTools` column (`{type, name}`) covers agents without DCM:

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| where array_length(DeclaredTools) > 0
| mv-expand Tool = DeclaredTools
| summarize AgentCount = dcount(AgentId)
    by ToolType = tostring(Tool.type), ToolName = tostring(Tool.name)
| order by AgentCount desc
```

> **Coverage caveat:** The DCM query yields deep operation-level detail but only for the connector-sourced subset. The `DeclaredTools` fallback is broader but flatter (tool name/type only, no operation IDs). Run both for the fullest picture.

### Query 13: Operation-Level Privilege Mapping

🔐 **Privilege query** — buckets every declared operation into a **sensitivity category** (mail-send, directory-write, data-write, messaging, security-tooling, read/other) to surface where write/exfiltration capability concentrates. Feeds the **Capability Privilege Index** supplementary indicator.

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| where isnotempty(tostring(RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata))
| mv-expand DCM = RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata
| mv-expand Action = DCM.actions
| mv-expand Api = Action.apis
| mv-expand Op = Api.operations
| extend OperationId = tostring(Op.operationId)
| where isnotempty(OperationId)
| extend PrivilegeCategory = case(
    OperationId has_any ("Send an email", "SendEmail", "Send email"), "Mail-Send",
    OperationId has_any ("AddUserToGroup", "RemoveMember", "UpdatePerson", "UpdateOrganisation", "Create user", "Delete user", "Update user", "Assign"), "Directory-Write",
    OperationId has_any ("unbound action", "Create a row", "Update a row", "Delete a row", "Create record", "Update record"), "Data-Write",
    OperationId has_any ("Post message", "Post a message", "Send message", "Create chat", "post in a chat"), "Messaging",
    OperationId has_any ("Security Copilot", "Sentinel"), "Security-Tooling",
    "Other/Read")
| summarize AgentCount = dcount(AgentId) by PrivilegeCategory
| order by AgentCount desc
```

**Capability Privilege Index** — distinct agents holding ≥1 *sensitive* (write/send) operation, split by broad access:

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| where isnotempty(tostring(RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata))
| extend AllowAllUsers = tostring(RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers)
| mv-expand DCM = RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata
| mv-expand Action = DCM.actions
| mv-expand Api = Action.apis
| mv-expand Op = Api.operations
| extend OperationId = tostring(Op.operationId)
| where OperationId has_any ("Send an email", "SendEmail", "AddUserToGroup", "RemoveMember", "UpdatePerson", "UpdateOrganisation", "unbound action", "Create a row", "Update a row", "Delete a row", "Post message", "post in a chat")
| summarize SensitiveAgents = dcount(AgentId),
            BroadAndSensitive = dcountif(AgentId, AllowAllUsers == "true")
```

> **Interpretation:** `BroadAndSensitive > 0` is a direct privilege-abuse signal — a broadly-accessible agent that can write to the directory, write data, or send mail. These agents justify maxing the Broad Access and/or XPIA dimensions. Tune the operation keyword lists to your tenant's connector set.

### Query 14: Deep-Manifest Coverage (Report Banner)

📊 **Coverage query** — reports what fraction of the fleet carries the deep `declarativeCopilotMetadata` (DCM) that the XPIA, endpoint, and capability queries depend on. **Run this every report** and surface the result as a banner so the analyst knows what was *not* fully inspected.

```kql
AgentsInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId
| where LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"
| summarize Total = count(),
            WithDCM = countif(isnotempty(tostring(RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata))),
            WithInstructions = countif(isnotempty(Instructions)),
            WithObservabilityID = countif(isnotempty(ObservabilityID)),
            WithEntraAgentID = countif(isnotempty(EntraAgentID))
| extend DcmCoveragePct = round(100.0 * WithDCM / Total, 1),
         InstrCoveragePct = round(100.0 * WithInstructions / Total, 1),
         ObsIdPct = round(100.0 * WithObservabilityID / Total, 1),
         EntraIdPct = round(100.0 * WithEntraAgentID / Total, 1)
```

> **Why both ID columns:** `ObservabilityID` is near-universally populated (~100%) and is the natural runtime-correlation handle; `EntraAgentID` is sparse (only agents provisioned with an Entra Agent ID). Report both so the analyst knows which runtime/identity correlations are feasible.

### Query 15: Runtime Correlation — Active-and-Dangerous (Scoped)

🎯 **Runtime query (Phase 5)** — confirms which *flagged* agents are actually active. **Scoped by name list — no fleet-wide join** (see Phase 5 for why a full join times out). Populate `FlaggedNames` from the Q4 broadly-accessible and Q13 sensitive-op results.

```kql
let FlaggedNames = dynamic(["<broadly-accessible or sensitive-op agent names from Q4/Q13>"]);
CopilotActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where AgentName in (FlaggedNames)
| summarize Interactions = count(),
            DistinctUsers = dcount(ActorUserId),
            LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated),
            SrcIPs = dcount(SrcIpAddr) by AgentName
| order by Interactions desc
```

> **Interpretation:** A flagged agent appearing here with real `Interactions` is **active-and-dangerous** — prioritize for remediation over dormant flagged agents. **Join key is `AgentName`** (`CopilotActivity.AgentId` is a composite prefixed string that does NOT equal `AgentsInfo.AgentId`). Absence here does not prove dormancy — most `CopilotActivity` rows are unattributed (empty `AgentName`). `AIModelName` is sparse in this table; do not rely on it for model inventory.

---

## 🔓 Access Posture

> **Authentication-type gap:** `AgentsInfo` has no equivalent to the old `UserAuthenticationType` (None/Microsoft/Custom). The `ToolsAuthenticationType` column is effectively empty in practice. Access exposure is assessed via the `RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers` governance signal instead — a **proxy for broad exposure, not an authentication state**.

### Access Distribution (Q3)
| App Type | Allow-All-Users | Count |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| <appType> | <true/false> | <N> |

### 🔴 Broadly-Accessible Agents (Q4)

<If Q4 returns results:>
| Agent Name | Platform | App Type | Published | Created |
|------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| <name> | <platform> | <appType> | <status> | <date> |

<If Q4 returns 0:>
✅ No broadly-accessible agents (`allowForAllUsers == "true"`) detected.

---

## 📧 XPIA Email Exfiltration Risk

<If Q5 returns results:>
| Agent Name | Platform | Email Operation | Broadly Accessible |
|------------|----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| <name> | <platform> | <operationId> | 🔴 Yes / 🟢 No |

**Risk Assessment:**
- 🔴 Email-capable agents can be exploited via XPIA to exfiltrate data, especially when combined with declared data sources (Q7).
- ⚠️ Recommendation: Review recipient controls; apply Power Platform DLP and Defender Runtime Protection.

> **Coverage caveat:** Email capability is detected from DCM `operations[].operationId` (e.g., "Send an email", "SendEmail"). There is no longer a GenAI-orchestration flag or an `inputs` field, so AI-controlled-vs-hardcoded recipient distinction is **not available** — treat all email-capable agents as candidates. Only the DCM-bearing subset is covered.

<If Q5 returns 0:>
✅ No email-capable agents detected in the DCM-bearing subset.

---

## 🛠️ MCP Server Exposure

<If Q6 returns results:>
| Agent Name | Platform | MCP Servers | Broadly Accessible |
|------------|----------|-------------|--------------------|
| <name> | <platform> | <server list> | <yes/no> |

**MCP Server Distribution:**
| MCP Server | Agent Count |
|------------|-------------|
| <server> | <N> |

<If Q6 returns 0:>
✅ No agents with MCP servers detected.

> **Coverage caveat:** The `McpServers` column is flat (`{name, description}` only) — no server URLs, credential config, or transport detail. Non-HTTPS/hardcoded-cred MCP detection from the old schema is not possible here.

> **Dimension note:** MCP exposure and the External Endpoint findings (below) both feed the single **Tool & Endpoint Exposure** score dimension. Any insecure scheme, non-standard port, or external endpoint on a broadly-accessible agent escalates that dimension to High regardless of MCP count.

---

## 📚 Declared Data Source Exposure

<If Q7 returns results:>
| Agent Name | Platform | Data Sources | Broadly Accessible |
|------------|----------|--------------|--------------------|
| <name> | <platform> | <source names> | <yes/no> |

**⚠️ High-Risk Combinations:**
<List agents with declared data sources + allowForAllUsers == "true", and agents combining data sources with email capability (Q5)>

<If Q7 returns 0:>
✅ No declared data sources found on any agents.

> **Coverage caveat:** `DeclaredDataSources` stores source **names/filenames** only — source *type* classification (SharePoint vs public site vs federated) is not available.

---

## 🔑 Credential Hygiene

<If Q8 returns results:>
🔴 **Hard-coded credential patterns detected in <N> agent(s):**
| Agent Name | Platform | Status | Creator |
|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| <name> | <platform> | <status> | <creatorId/upn> |

⚠️ **Recommendation:** Move secrets to Azure Key Vault; use environment variables at runtime.

<If Q8 returns 0:>
✅ No hard-coded credential patterns detected in agent instructions or connector metadata.

---

## 🌐 External Endpoint & HTTP Risk

<If Q9 returns results:>
| Agent | API Type | Scheme | Host | Port | Insecure | Non-Standard Port |
|-------|----------|--------|------|------|----------|-------------------|
| <name> | <OpenApi/RemoteMCPServer> | <scheme> | <host> | <port> | 🔴/🟢 | 🔴/🟢 |

<If Q9 returns 0:>
✅ No external endpoints with insecure schemes or non-standard ports detected.

> **Coverage caveat:** Only `OpenApi` + `RemoteMCPServer` connectors declare `serverUrls`. Power Platform `api_action` connectors do not expose destination URLs.

---

## 👥 Creator Governance

### Top Creators
| Creator | Agents | Published | Generic Names | No Description |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| <upn/creatorId> | <N> | <N> | <N> | <N> |

### Naming Hygiene
- Agents with generic names ("Agent", "Test"): <N>
- Agents with no description: <N>

> **Coverage caveat:** Only agents with a populated `RawAgentInfo.creatorId` are attributed; GUIDs unresolved in `IdentityInfo` fall back to the raw GUID.

## 🔐 Capability Privilege Index (Supplementary — not summed into score)

**Operation sensitivity distribution (Q13):**
| Privilege Category | Agent Count |

| Mail-Send | <N> |
| Directory-Write | <N> |
| Data-Write | <N> |
| Messaging | <N> |
| Security-Tooling | <N> |
| Other/Read | <N> |

**Index:** <SensitiveAgents> agent(s) hold ≥1 sensitive (write/send) operation; **<BroadAndSensitive>** of those are also broadly accessible (`allowForAllUsers == "true"`).

<If BroadAndSensitive > 0:>
🔴 **<BroadAndSensitive> broadly-accessible agent(s) with sensitive write/send capability** — direct privilege-abuse exposure. These justify maxing the Broad Access and/or XPIA dimensions.

<If BroadAndSensitive == 0:>
✅ No broadly-accessible agents hold sensitive write/send operations (within the DCM-bearing subset).

> Supplementary indicator — provides privilege context but is **not** added to the /100 composite. Coverage limited to the DCM-bearing subset (see banner).

## 🎯 Runtime Correlation — Active-and-Dangerous (Q15, Optional)

<If Phase 5 was run — flagged agents correlated against CopilotActivity:>
| Agent Name | Interactions | Distinct Users | Source IPs | Last Seen |
|------------|--------------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| <name> | <N> | <N> | <N> | <date> |

🔴 **Active-and-dangerous:** Flagged agents (broadly accessible / sensitive ops) confirmed active at runtime — prioritize for remediation over dormant flagged agents.

<If no flagged agents appear in CopilotActivity:>
✅ No flagged agents showed runtime activity in the window. *(Caveat: most `CopilotActivity` rows are unattributed — absence does not prove dormancy.)*

> Scoped name-based lookup (`AgentName` key). Runtime attribution is inherently low-coverage; this section confirms presence, not absence.

## Recommendations

> **Key mitigation — Runtime:** For all high-risk agents, recommend enabling **Microsoft Defender Runtime Protection** — webhook-based real-time inspection that can block malicious tool invocations before execution. See [Real-time agent protection during runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/real-time-agent-protection-during-runtime).

> **Key mitigation — Governance:** For fleet-wide governance gaps (sprawl, missing auth, uncontrolled tools), recommend adopting **[Microsoft Agent 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-agent-365-the-control-plane-for-ai-agents/)** as the enterprise control plane — providing centralized Registry (inventory + quarantine), Access Control (Entra agent IDs + Policy Templates), Visualization (agent ↔ resource mapping), and Security (Defender + Purview integration).

## Markdown File Report Template

When outputting to markdown file, use the same structure as the Inline Report Template above, saved to:

```
reports/ai-agent-posture/AI_Agent_Posture_Report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md
```

Include the following additional sections in the file report that are omitted from inline:

1. **Full agent detail table** (all non-deleted agents with key fields)
2. **Per-platform breakdown** (agent counts and creators by `Platform`)
3. **Complete data source listing** (every declared source name, not just examples)
4. **Complete MCP agent listing** (every MCP agent with full server list)
5. **Raw query references** — note that full query definitions are in this SKILL.md file

### File Report Header

```markdown

## Known Pitfalls

### 1. AgentsInfo Is Advanced Hunting Only

**Problem:** The `AgentsInfo` table does NOT exist in Sentinel Data Lake. Querying via `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` returns `SemanticError: Failed to resolve table`.

**Solution:** Always use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery`. The table has 30-day retention in AH.

### 2. Multiple Records Per Agent (State Snapshots)

**Problem:** The table logs configuration snapshots over time. Querying without deduplication returns inflated counts and duplicate agent entries.

**Solution:** Always use `| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId` to get the latest state per agent before any analysis. Note `AgentId` is a **guid** and the column is `Name`/`Description` (not `AgentName`/`AgentDescription` as some docs state).

### 3. RawAgentInfo Is the Real Detail Source

**Problem:** The normalized columns (`DeclaredTools`, `McpServers`, `DeclaredDataSources`, `Owners`, `Capabilities`) are **sparsely populated and flat**. The rich governance/configuration detail lives in the `RawAgentInfo` dynamic column (populated for ~all agents) and, for the connector-sourced subset, in `RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata` (DCM).

**Solution:** For creator (`RawAgentInfo.creatorId`), broad access (`RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers`), app type (`RawAgentInfo.appType`), and deep capability/endpoint detail, parse `RawAgentInfo`. `RawAgentInfo` is dynamic — no double-parse needed; access nested keys directly with `tostring(RawAgentInfo.key)`.

### 4. declarativeCopilotMetadata (DCM) Covers Only a Subset

**Problem:** Deep capability queries (Q5 email, Q9 endpoints, Q12 operations) depend on `RawAgentInfo.declarativeCopilotMetadata`, which is present for only ~10% of Copilot Studio agents (the connector-sourced subset). The majority have only a shallow manifest.

**Solution:** Always state the coverage caveat in reports. DCM path: `declarativeCopilotMetadata[].actions[].apis[]` with `.type` (OpenApi/RemoteMCPServer/api_action), `.serverUrls[]`, and `.operations[].operationId`. Results from these queries are a **floor, not a complete inventory**.

### 5. Authentication-Type Detection Has No Equivalent

**Problem:** The old `UserAuthenticationType` (None/Microsoft/Custom) is gone. The `ToolsAuthenticationType` column exists in schema but is effectively empty (~100% blank). There is **no way** to classify agents as "unauthenticated" the way the old skill did.

**Solution:** Use `RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers == "true"` as a **broad-exposure proxy** (documented as a proxy, NOT an authentication state). Never claim an agent is "unauthenticated" — say "broadly accessible".

### 6. Many Schema Columns Are Empty in Practice

**Problem:** `ToolsAuthenticationType`, `Availability`, `Endpoints`, `Triggers`, `Permissions`, and `Model` are present in the schema but empty/null in practice. Queries built on them silently return 0 rows.

**Solution:** Do not build core logic on these columns. Validate population with a quick `summarize countif(isnotempty(<col>))` before relying on a column. `LifecycleStatus` is blank for active agents (only `Deleted` is populated) — `LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"` correctly passes blanks.

### 7. creatorId Is a GUID — Join IdentityInfo for UPN

**Problem:** `RawAgentInfo.creatorId` is an Entra object GUID, not a UPN. There is no `CreatorAccountUpn`, `LastModifiedByUpn`, or `LastPublishedByUpn` equivalent.

**Solution:** Resolve via `leftouter` join to `IdentityInfo` on `AccountObjectId`, then `coalesce(AccountUpn, CreatorId)`. Creator attribution is a lower bound — `creatorId` is sparse.

### 8. serverUrls Only Populated for OpenApi & RemoteMCPServer

**Problem:** External endpoint URLs in DCM `apis[].serverUrls` are populated for `OpenApi` and `RemoteMCPServer` connector types, but **not** for `api_action` (Power Platform connectors, the majority). Filtering all API types yields mostly empty URLs.

**Solution:** Filter `ApiType in ("OpenApi", "RemoteMCPServer")` before expanding `serverUrls`. State that `api_action` destinations are not inventoried.

### 9. McpServers Is Flat (Name/Description Only)

**Problem:** The dedicated `McpServers` column contains only `{name, description}` — no server URLs, credential configuration, or transport detail. Non-HTTPS MCP detection and hardcoded-cred-in-MCP detection from the old design are not possible.

**Solution:** Use `McpServers` for inventory/exposure counts only. For MCP server endpoints, fall back to the DCM `RemoteMCPServer` API type (Q9).

### 10. AH Booleans Are Textual True/False (Feb 25, 2026)

**Problem:** Since Feb 25, 2026, Advanced Hunting boolean results render as textual `True`/`False`, not `1`/`0`. Governance flags from `RawAgentInfo` (e.g., `allowForAllUsers`) are JSON strings (`"true"`/`"false"`).

**Solution:** Compare against the string form: `tostring(RawAgentInfo.allowForAllUsers) == "true"`. Avoid `== 1` / `== true` numeric/bool comparisons on parsed JSON values.

### 11. CopilotActivity Correlation — Composite AgentId & Fleet-Join Timeouts

**Problem:** Phase 5 runtime correlation against `CopilotActivity` has three traps: (1) `CopilotActivity.AgentId` is a **composite/prefixed string** (e.g., `T_<tenant>.<guid>`, `CopilotStudio.Declarative.T_….gpt.<guid>`, or literals like `AgentBuilder`) that does **not** equal the clean `AgentsInfo.AgentId` GUID — ID joins return 0 matches. (2) A fleet-wide `AgentsInfo` ↔ `CopilotActivity` join (~15k agents × 100k+ rows, heavy `RawAgentInfo`) **times out** the AH endpoint. (3) Most `CopilotActivity` rows have an **empty** `AgentName`/`AgentId` (general M365 Copilot usage), so runtime attribution is low-coverage.

**Solution:** Use a **scoped name-based lookup** (Query 15): build a small flagged-name list from Q4/Q13, then `CopilotActivity | where AgentName in (FlaggedNames)` — no join. **`AgentName` is the reliable cross-table key.** Never join the full fleet. Treat absence from `CopilotActivity` as *unconfirmed*, not proof of dormancy. `AIModelName` is sparse here — do not use it for model inventory.

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering the report, verify:

- [ ] All queries used `arg_max(Timestamp, *) by AgentId` for deduplication
- [ ] All queries filtered `LifecycleStatus != "Deleted"` (unless auditing deletions)
- [ ] All queries ran via `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` (not Data Lake)
- [ ] Zero-result queries are reported with explicit absence confirmation (✅ pattern)
- [ ] The Agent Security Score calculation is transparent with per-dimension evidence

- [ ] **Deep-Manifest Coverage banner (Q14) is present at the top of the report** (DCM %, ObservabilityID %, EntraAgentID %)
- [ ] **Capability Privilege Index (Q13) is reported** as a supplementary indicator, explicitly noted as NOT summed into the /100 score
- [ ] **If Phase 5 ran, runtime correlation is SCOPED by `AgentName` (Query 15) — never a fleet-wide join**; absence is described as unconfirmed, not dormant
- [ ] Score card uses the **Tool & Endpoint Exposure** dimension label (not "MCP Server Expo") and shows the two supplementary indicators
- [ ] MCP server inventory includes server names, not just counts
- [ ] Declared data sources note that source-type classification is unavailable
- [ ] Creator governance resolves `creatorId` GUIDs via `IdentityInfo` and notes the lower-bound caveat
- [ ] Recommendations are prioritized and evidence-based
- [ ] All hyperlinks in the report are copied verbatim from the URL Registry — no fabricated or recalled-from-memory URLs
- [ ] No PII from live environments in the SKILL.md file itself

## SVG Dashboard Generation

> 📊 **Optional post-report step.** After an AI Agent Security Posture report is generated, the user can request a visual SVG dashboard.

**Trigger phrases:** "generate SVG dashboard", "create a visual dashboard", "visualize this report", "SVG from the report"

### How to Request a Dashboard

- **Same chat:** "Generate an SVG dashboard from the report" — data is already in context.
- **New chat:** Attach or reference the report file, e.g. `#file:reports/ai-agent-posture/AI_Agent_Posture_Report_<org>_<date>.md`
- **Customization:** Edit [svg-widgets.yaml](svg-widgets.yaml) before requesting — the renderer reads it at generation time.

### Execution

```
Step 1:  Read svg-widgets.yaml (this skill's widget manifest)
Step 2:  Read .github/skills/svg-dashboard/SKILL.md (rendering rules — Manifest Mode)
Step 3:  Read the completed report file (data source)
Step 4:  Render SVG → save to reports/ai-agent-posture/{report_name}_dashboard.svg
```

The YAML manifest is the single source of truth for layout, widgets, field mappings, colors, and data source documentation. All customization happens there.
